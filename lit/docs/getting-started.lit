\title{Getting Started}

This tutorial will guide you through the basics of creating Concourse
pipelines. You will use a local instance of Concourse running on your machine to
run pipelines.

Before getting started you should have the following installed:

\list{
  \link{Docker}{https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/}
}{
  \link{Docker-compose}{https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/}
}

This tutorial assumes you understand what Linux containers are and how to work
with them. If you know what a Dockerfile is and how to make your own then you're
probably good to jump into this tutorial. If you're not familiar with Linux
containers then you may want to \link{get started with
Docker}{https://docs.docker.com/get-started/} first before diving into this
tutorial.

It will also help if you know how to read YAML. We have a quick
\reference{intro-to-yaml} if you're not familiar with the syntax.
