\title{Operation}{operation}

The following sections describes operator-focused features and tools that
Concourse provides, such as monitoring and credential management.

These concepts are not required to operate Concourse, but are for users that
are looking to extend the capabilities of managing a Concourse deployment. For
users that are new to these concepts, we do recommend learning how to set up
\reference{creds} and \reference{encryption}.
