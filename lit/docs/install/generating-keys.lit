\section{
  \title{Generating the Keys}

  Concourse's various components use RSA keys to verify tokens and worker
  registration requests.

  A minimal deployment will require the following keys:

  \definitions{
    \definition{\bold{Session Signing Key}}{
      Used by the \reference{web-node} for signing and verifying user session
      tokens.
    }
  }{
    \definition{\bold{TSA Host Key}}{
      Used by the \reference{web-node} for the SSH worker registration gateway
      server ("TSA").

      The public key is given to each \reference{worker-node} to verify the
      remote host when connecting via SSH.
    }
  }{
    \definition{\bold{Worker Key}}{
      Each \reference{worker-node} verifies its registration with the
      \reference{web-node} via a SSH key.

      The public key must be listed in the \reference{web-node}'s
      \italic{authorized worker keys} file in order for the worker to register.
    }
  }

  To generate these keys, run:

  \codeblock{bash}{{
  concourse generate-key -t rsa -f ./session_signing_key
  concourse generate-key -t ssh -f ./tsa_host_key
  concourse generate-key -t ssh -f ./worker_key
  }}

  or use \code{ssh-keygen}:

  \codeblock{bash}{{
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f ./session_signing_key
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f ./tsa_host_key
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f ./worker_key
  }}

  At this point you should have the following files:

  \list{
  \code{session_signing_key}
  }{
  \code{tsa_host_key}
  }{
  \code{tsa_host_key.pub}
  }{
  \code{worker_key}
  }{
  \code{worker_key.pub}
  }

  You can remove the \code{session_signing_key.pub} file if you have one, it is
  not needed by any process in Concourse.
}

\section{
  \title{Multiple Worker Keys}{multiple-worker-keys}

  Currently you have one \code{worker_key}. You can use this one key-pair with
  multiple \reference{concourse-worker}s. Another good strategy is to have each
  worker or group of workers use a key that's unique to that one worker or group
  of workers.

  In the second case you will end up with multiple private and public worker
  keys. The \reference{concourse-web} needs to know about all of the public
  worker keys.  To pass all public worker keys to the \reference{concourse-web}
  create a file that contains all of the worker public keys. A common name for
  this file is \code{authorized_worker_keys.pub}. The file should look like this,
  with one public key per line.

  \codeblock{bash}{{
  $ cat authorized_worker_keys.pub
  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQCgKtVnbGRJ7Y63QKoO+loS...
  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDU6lA4gSRYIc4MXzphJ2l5...
  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDgNU7KBz/QQusPO52pNcea...
  }}

  You should now have all the necessary keys needed to deploy Web and Worker nodes.
