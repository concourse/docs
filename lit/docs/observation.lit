\title{Observation}{observation}

This section outlines everything you need to know for monitoring the state of
your pipelines.

\section{
  \title{The Dashboard}{dashboard}

  The dashboard, available at the default route (\code{/}), provides a
  bird's-eye view of the Concourse cluster. All visible pipelines across all
  teams are listed here. A high-density (HD) view is available at \code{/hd}.
}

\section{
  \title{\code{cc.xml}}

  The Concourse API can return the status of a team's pipelines in a format
  compatible with tools like \link{CCMenu}{http://ccmenu.org/}. This endpoint
  is available at the following route:

  \code{{{
  /api/v1/teams/{team}/cc.xml
  }}}
}

\section{
  \title{Badges}

  The Concourse API supports returning SVG badges indicating the status of a
  job:

  \code{{{
  /api/v1/teams/{team}/pipelines/{pipeline}/jobs/{job}/badge
  }}}

  ...and for an entire pipeline:

  \code{{{
  /api/v1/teams/{team}/pipelines/{pipeline}/badge
  }}}

  This can be used to annotate your READMEs with a build status badge like so:

  \codeblock{md}{{{
  ![CI](https://ci.concourse-ci.org/api/v1/teams/main/pipelines/concourse/jobs/unit/badge)
  }}}

  ...which should render the following:

  \image{https://ci.concourse-ci.org/api/v1/teams/main/pipelines/concourse/jobs/unit/badge}

  If you want the image to link to your pipeline/job in a README, use HTML:

  \codeblock{html}{{{
    <a href="https://ci.concourse-ci.org/teams/main/pipelines/concourse/jobs/unit/badge">
      <img src="https://ci.concourse-ci.org/api/v1/teams/main/pipelines/concourse/jobs/unit/badge" alt="Concourse Pipeline Status">
    </a>
  }}}
}

\section{
  \title{Pipeline Visibility}

  Pipelines may be exposed so that they can be monitored without having to
  authenticate. For more information, see \reference{exposing}.
