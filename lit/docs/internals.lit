This section provides a deeper understanding of some of the concepts
surrounding Concourse.

An understanding of the basics of Concourse concepts, such as pipelines, jobs,
etc, is recommended as parts of this section might assume a level of knowledge
from them. This section is not necessary for using Concourse but are more for
experienced users that want to dig deeper into how Concourse works.

\section{
  \title{Basic architecture}

  Concourse is a fairly simple distributed system built up from the following
  components. You'll see them referenced here and there throughout the
  documentation, so you may want to skim this page just to get an idea of what
  they are.

\section{
  \title{ATC\aux{: web UI & build scheduler}}{component-atc}

  The ATC is the heart of Concourse. It runs the web UI and API and is
  responsible for all pipeline scheduling. It connects to PostgreSQL, which it
  uses to store pipeline data (including build logs).

  Multiple ATCs can be running as one cluster; as long as they're all pointing
  to the same database, they'll synchronize using basic locking mechanisms and
  roughly spread work across the cluster.

  The ATC by default listens on port \code{8080}, and is usually colocated with
  the \reference{component-tsa}{TSA} and sitting behind a load balancer.

  \bold{Note:} for \reference{fly-intercept} to function, make sure your load
  balancer is configured to do TCP or SSL forwarding, not HTTP or HTTPS.

  There are multiple components within the ATC that each have their own set of
  responsibilities. The main components consist of the
  \reference{checker}{checker}, \reference{scheduler}{scheduler},
  \reference{build-tracker}{build tracker} and the
  \reference{garbage-collector}{garbage collector}.

  The \reference{checker}{checker}'s responsibility is to continously checks
  for new versions of resources. The \reference{scheduler}{scheduler} is
  responsible for scheduling builds for a job and the
  \reference{build-tracker}{build tracker} is responsible for running any
  scheduled builds. The \reference{garbage-collector}{garbage collector} is the
  cleanup mechanism for removing any unused or outdated objects, such as
  containers and volumes.

  \table-of-contents

  All the components in a Concourse deployment can be viewed in the
  \italic{components} table in the database as of v5.7.0. The intervals that
  the components run at can also be adjusted through editing that table, as
  well as pausing the component from running entirely.

\section{
  \title{TSA\aux{: worker registration & forwarding}}{component-tsa}

  The TSA is a custom-built SSH server that is used solely for securely
  registering \reference{architecture-worker}{workers} with the
  \reference{component-atc}{ATC}.

  The TSA by default listens on port \code{2222}, and is usually colocated with
  the \reference{component-atc}{ATC} and sitting behind a load balancer.

  The TSA implements CLI over the SSH connection, supporting the following
  commands:

  \list{
    The \code{forward-worker} command is used to reverse-tunnel a worker's
    addresses through the TSA and register the forwarded connections with the
    ATC. This allows workers running in arbitrary networks to register
    securely, so long as they can reach the TSA. This is much safer than
    opening the worker up to the outside world.
  }{
    The \code{land-worker} command is sent from the worker when landing, and
    initiates the state change to \reference{LANDING-table} through the ATC.
  }{
    The \code{retire-worker} command is sent from the worker when retiring, and
    initiates the state change to \reference{RETIRING-table} through the ATC.
  }{
    The \code{delete-worker} command is sent from the worker when draining is
    interrupted while a worker is retiring. It removes the worker from the ATC.
  }{
    The \code{sweep-containers} command is sent periodically to facilitate
    garbage collection of containers which can be removed from the worker. It
    returns a list of handles for containers in the \code{DESTROYING} state,
    and it is the worker's job to subsequently destroy them.
  }{
    The \code{report-containers} command is sent along with the list of all
    container handles on the worker. The ATC uses this to update the database,
    removing any \code{DESTROYING} containers which are no longer in the set of
    handles, and marking any \code{CREATED} containers that are not present as
    missing.
  }{
    The \code{sweep-volumes} command is sent periodically to facilitate garbage
    collection of volumes which can be removed from the worker. It returns a
    list of handles for volumes in the \code{DESTROYING} state, and it is the
    worker's job to subsequently destroy them.
  }{
    The \code{report-volumes} command is sent along with the list of all volume
    handles on the worker. The ATC uses this to update the database, removing
    any \code{DESTROYING} volumes which are no longer in the set of handles,
    and marking any \code{CREATED} volumes that are not present as missing.
  }

\section{
  \title{Workers Architecture}{architecture-worker}

  Workers are machines running
  \link{Garden}{https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden} and
  \link{Baggageclaim}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/tree/master/worker/baggageclaim}
  servers and registering themselves via the \reference{component-tsa}{TSA}.

  \aside{
    \bold{Note}: Windows and Darwin workers also run Garden and Baggageclaim
    servers but do not run containers. They both use
    \link{houdini}{https://github.com/vito/houdini} to fake making containers.
    Windows containers are not supported and Darwin does not have native
    container technology.
  }

  Workers have no important state configured on their machines, as everything
  runs in a container and thus shouldn't care about what packages are installed
  on the host (well, except for those that allow it to be a worker in the first
  place). This is very different from workers in other non-containerized CI
  solutions, where the state of packages on the worker is crucial to whether
  your pipeline works or not.

  Each worker registers itself with the Concourse cluster via the
  \reference{component-tsa}{TSA}.

  Workers by default listen on port \code{7777} for Garden and port \code{7788}
  for Baggageclaim. Connections to both servers are forwarded over the SSH
  connection made to the \reference{component-tsa}{TSA}.

  \section{
    \title{The worker lifecycle}{worker-lifecycle}

    \define-table{RUNNING}{
      A worker in this state is registered with the cluster and ready to start
      running containers and storing volumes.
    }

    \define-table{STALLED}{
      A worker in this state was previously registered with the cluster, but
      stopped advertising itself for some reason. Ususally this is due to
      network connectivity issues, or the worker stopping unexpectedly.

      If the worker remains in this state and cannot be recovered, it can be
      removed using the \reference{fly-prune-worker} command.
    }

    \define-table{LANDING}{
      The \code{concourse land-worker} command will put a worker in the LANDING
      state to safely drain its assignments for temporary downtime.

      The ATC will wait for builds on the worker for jobs which aren't
      interruptible to finish, and transition the worker into
      \reference{LANDED-table} state.
    }

    \define-table{LANDED}{
      A worker in this state has successfully waited for all non-interruptible
      jobs on it after having \code{concourse land-worker} called. It will no
      longer be used to schedule any new containers or create volumes until it
      registers as \reference{RUNNING-table} again.
    }

    \define-table{RETIRING}{
      The \code{concourse retire-worker} command will put a worker in the
      RETIRING state to remove it from the cluster permanently.

      The ATC will wait for builds on the worker for jobs which aren't
      interruptible to finish, and remove the worker.
    }
  }
