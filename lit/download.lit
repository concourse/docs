  \warn{
    If you are currently on a version older than \reference{v3.6.0}, \bold{you
    must first upgrade to \reference{v3.6.0} before upgrading past it!}
  }

  \warn{
    If you are currently on \reference{v3.6.0} and looking to upgrade to
    \reference{v4.1.0} and above, you must first upgrade to \reference{v4.0.0}.
  }

  \warn{
    Please configure either the environment variable
    \code{CONCOURSE_X_FRAME_OPTIONS} or \code{--x-frame-options} command line
    argument to \code{deny} or \code{sameorigin} for the \code{concourse} binary.

    This prevents the Concourse UI from being embedded as an iframe and prevents
    clickjacking exploits.

    \bold{Note:} If setting the value to \code{allow-from}, please note that not
    all browsers support this value and when not supported, the header is ignored
    by the browser.
