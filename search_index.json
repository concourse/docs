Concourse pipelines represent a dependency flow, kind of like distributed Makefiles. Pipelines are designed to be self-contained so as to minimize server-wide configuration. Maximizing portability also mitigates risk, making it easier for projects to recover from CI disasters.\n\nResources like the git resource and s3 resource are used to express source code, dependencies, deployments, and any other external state. This interface is also used to model more abstract things like scheduled or interval triggers, via the time resource.\n\nResource Types are defined as part of the pipeline itself, making the pipelines more self-contained and keeping Concourse itself small and generic without resorting to a complicated plugin system.\n\nJobs are sequences get, put, and task steps to execute. These steps determine the job's inputs and outputs. Jobs are designed to be idempotent and loosely coupled, allowing the pipeline to grow with the project's needs without requiring engineers to keep too much in their head at a time.\n\nEverything in Concourse runs in a container.

Containers are identified by a few things, so you may need to specify a few flags to hone down the results. If there are multiple containers that the flags could refer to, an interactive prompt will show up allowing you to disambiguate.\n\nFor example, running the following will run a task and then enter the finished task's container:\n\n$ fly -t example execute\n$ fly -t example intercept --step build\nWhen intercepting a task running on a Windows worker, you will need to specifically tell fly to to run powershell:\n\n$ fly -t example intercept powershell\nContainers are around for a short time after a build finishes in order to allow people to intercept them.\n\nYou can also intercept builds that were run in your pipeline.

This number was chosen arbitrarily and may be reduced in the future. It's important to note that the collector must be able to run frequently enough to not be outpaced by the workload producing things, and so the batch operation should be able to complete pretty quickly.\n\nThe batch operation first performs garbage collection within the database alone, removing rows that are no longer needed. The removal of rows from one stage will often result in removals in a later stage.  They are run in the following order:\n\n* builds that no longer meet the Build Retention criteria are marked non-interceptible\n\n* workers are stepped through their state machine. Unresponsive workers become STALLED, workers that are RETIRING are deleted once drained, and workers that are LANDING become LANDED once drained.\n\n* build_image_resource_caches are removed for builds that finished over 24 hours ago.\n\n* resource_cache_uses are removed for builds that are no longer interceptible.\n\n* resource_configs that are no longer referenced by a resource_caches (resource_config_id) or a resource_config_check_sessions (resource_config_id) are removed.\n\n* resource_caches that are no longer referenced by a resource_configs (resource_cache_id) or a resource_cache_uses (resource_cache_id) are removed.\n\n* resource_config_check_sessions that have exceeded their resource_config_check_sessions (expires_at) are removed.\n\nIf any of the above operations fail, the garbage collector will just log an error and move on. This is so that failure to collect one class of objects does not prevent everything else from being garbage collected. Failure at any part of the garbage collection is OK; it can just retry on the next pass.\n\nAfter the initial pass of garbage collection in the database, there should now be a set of volumes and containers that meet criteria for garbage collection. These two are a bit more complicated to garbage-collect; they both require talking to a worker, and waiting on a potentially slow delete.\n\nContainers and volumes are the costliest resources consumed by Concourse. There are also many of them created over time as builds execute and pipelines perform their resource checking. Therefore it is important to parallelize this aspect of garbage collection so that one slow delete or one slow worker does not cause them to pile up.\n\nSo, the next two steps are Container Collection and Volume Collection.\n\n","depth":4,"section_tag":"how-it-works"},"http response time":{"location":"metrics.html#http response time","title":"http response time","text":"This metric is emitted for each HTTP request to an ATC (both API and web requests).

The resulting sequence of jobs and resources is a dependency graph that continuously pushes your project forward, from source code to production.\n\nYour pipeline configuration is then visualized in the web UI, taking only one click to get from a red (failed) box to seeing why it failed.\n\nThe visualization also provides a \"gut check\" feedback loop - if it looks wrong, it probably is wrong.\n\nAll administration is done using the fly CLI. The fly set-pipeline command pushes the config up to Concourse. Once it looks good, you can then check the file in to source control. This makes it easy to recover if your Concourse server burns down.\n\nEverything runs in containers, ensuring a clean environment on every run. Each task specifies its own image, giving it full control over its dependencies, rather than managing them on your workers.\n\nThe fly intercept command will pop you right into one of your build's containers, which can be useful for debugging.\n\nThe fly execute command executes a task as a one-off build, with your local changes. This will run your code in exactly the same way it would run in your pipeline, without you having to repeatedly push broken commits until it works. Achieve the fabled green build #1!\n\nWhen a job fails, you can also use fly execute with -j flag to run with the same inputs as the failed job. You can then replace an input with your local changes with -i to test if your fix is valid.\n\nConcourse does not have a complex plugin system. Instead, it has a single strong abstraction.\n\nThe resources section of a pipeline lists Resources, which are abstract external locations where your pipeline will monitor for changes, fetch bits from, and push bits to.\n\nFor example, a resource with type git refers to a git repository, which will be cloned in a get step and pushed to in a put step. Behind the scenes, Concourse will continuously run git fetch to look for new commits that jobs may want to trigger on.\n\nAt its core, though, Concourse knows nothing about Git. It comes with a git resource type out of the box, but you could just as easily bring your own into your pipeline.

Pivotal Software, Inc. (“Pivotal”) owns a number of international trademarks and logos that identify the Concourse community and individual Concourse projects (“Concourse Marks”). These trademarks include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * Words: CONCOURSE\n\n  * Logos: {image: images/trademarks/concourse-black.png}\n\n  This policy outlines Pivotal’s policy and guidelines about the use of the Concourse trademarks by members of the Concourse development and user community.\n\n* WHY HAVE TRADEMARK GUIDELINES? The Concourse Marks are a symbol of the quality and community support associated with the Concourse open source software. Trademarks protect not only those using the marks but the entire community as well. Our community members need to know that they can rely on the quality and capabilities represented by the brand. We also want to provide a level playing field. No one should use the Concourse marks in ways that mislead or take advantage of the community or make unfair use of the trademarks. Also, use of the Concourse Marks should not be in a disparaging manner because we prefer that our marks not be used to be rude about the Concourse open source project or its members.\n\n* OPEN SOURCE LICENSE VS. TRADEMARKS. The Apache 2.0 license gives you the right to use, copy, distribute and modify the Concourse software. However, open source licenses like the Apache 2.0 license do not address trademarks.  Concourse Marks need to be used in a way consistent with trademark law, and that is why we have prepared this policy – to help you understand what branding is allowed or required when using our software under the Apache license.\n\n* PROPER USE OF THE CONCOURSE MARKS. We want to encourage a robust community for the Concourse open source project. Therefore, you may do any of the following, as long as you do so in a way that does not devalue, dilute, or disparage the Concourse brand. In other words, when you do these things, you should behave responsibly and reasonably in the interest of the community, but you do not need a trademark license from us to do them.\n\n  * Nominative Use. You may engage in “nominative use” of the Concourse name, but this does not allow you to use the logo.  Nominative use is sometimes called “fair use” of a trademark, and does not require a trademark license from us.  Here are examples:\n\n    * You may use the Concourse Marks in connection with the development of tools, add-ons, or utilities that are compatible with bit-for-bit identical copies of official Concourse software. For example, if you are developing a Foobar tool for Concourse, acceptable project titles would be “Foobar for Concourse\".\n\n    * You may use the Concourse Marks in connection with your non-commercial redistribution of (1) bit-for-bit identical copies of official Concourse software, and (2) unmodified copies of official Concourse source packages.  For example, if your Foobar product included a full redistribution of official Concourse Software or source code packages: \"Concourse-powered Foobar Product\". We strongly discourage, and likely would consider it a trademark problem, to use a name such as “Concourse Foobar.”\n\n    * If you offer maintenance, support, or hosting services for Concourse software, you may accurately state that in your marketing materials or portfolio, without using the Concourse logo.\n\n    * You may modify the Concourse software and state that your modified software is “based on the Concourse software” or a similar accurate statement, without using the Concourse logo.\n\n    * You may engage in community advocacy. The Concourse software is developed by and for its community. We will allow the use of the word trademark in this context, provided:\n\n      * The trademark is used in a manner consistent with this policy.\n\n      * There is no commercial purpose behind the use.\n\n      * There is no suggestion that your project is approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Concourse.\n\n      * You may create Concourse user or development groups, and publicize meetings or discussions for those groups.\n\n  * Attribution. Identify the trademarks as trademarks of Concourse, as set forth in Section 7.\n\n  * Redistribution of Binaries. If you redistribute binaries that you have downloaded from the Concourse repository, you should retain the logos and name of the product.  However, if you make any changes to the binaries (other than configuration or installation changes that do not involve changes to the source code), or if you re-build binaries from our source code, you should not use our logos.  Our logos represent our quality control, so they should be retained where the product has been built by us, but not otherwise.\n\n  * Capitalization. “Concourse” should always be capitalized and one word.\n\n* IMPROPER USE OF THE TRADEMARKS AND LOGOS. Use of the logo is reserved solely for use by Concourse in its unaltered form. Examples of unauthorized use of the Concourse trademarks include:\n\n  * Commercial Use: You may not use the Concourse Marks in connection with commercial redistribution of Concourse software (commercial redistribution includes, but is not limited to, redistribution in connection with any commercial business activities or revenue-generating business activities) regardless of whether the Concourse software is unmodified.\n\n  * Entity Names. You may not form a company, use a company name, or create a software product name that includes the “Concourse” trademark, or implies any foundational or authorship role. If you have a software product that works with Concourse, it is suggested you use terms such as ‘\u003cproduct name\u003e for Concourse’ or ‘\u003cproduct name\u003e, Concourse Edition.” If you wish to form an entity for a user or developer group, please contact us and we will be glad to discuss a license for a suitable name.\n\n  * Class or Quality. You may not imply that you are providing a class or quality of Concourse (e.g., \"enterprise-class\" or \"commercial quality\") in a way that implies Concourse is not of that class, grade or quality, nor that other parties are not of that class, grade, or quality.\n\n  * Combinations. Use of the Concourse Marks to identify software that combines any portion of the Concourse software with any other software, unless the combined distribution is an official Concourse distribution. For example, you may not distribute a combination of the Concourse  software with software released by the Foobar project under the name “Concourse Foobar Distro”.\n\n  * False or Misleading Statements. You may not make false or misleading statements regarding your use of Concourse (e.g., \"we wrote the majority of the code\" or \"we are major contributors\" or \"we are committers\").\n\n  * Domain Names. You must not use Concourse or any confusingly similar phrase in a domain name. For instance “www.concoursehost.com” is not allowed.  If you wish to use such a domain name for a non-commercial user or developer group to engage in community advocacy, please contact us and we will be glad to discuss a license for a suitable domain name.  Because of the many persons who, unfortunately, seek to spoof, swindle or deceive the community by using confusing domain names, we must be very strict about this rule.\n\n  * Merchandise. You must not manufacture, sell or give away merchandise items, such as T-shirts and mugs, bearing the Concourse logo, or create any mascot for the project. If you wish to use the logo to do this for a non-commercial user or developer group to engage in community advocacy, please contact us and we will be glad to discuss a license to do this.\n\n  * Variations, takeoffs or abbreviations. You may not use a variation of the Concourse name or logo for any purpose other than common usage of these in community communications. For example, the following are not acceptable:\n\n    * CONCRSE\n\n    * MyConcourse\n\n    * ConcourseDB\n\n    * ConcourseHost\n\n    * ConcourseGuru\n\n  * Endorsement or Sponsorship. You may not use the Concourse trademarks in a manner that would imply Concourse’s affiliation with or endorsement, sponsorship, or support of a product or service.\n\n  * Rebranding. You may not change the trademark on unmodified Concourse software to your own brand.  You may not hold yourself out as the source of the Concourse software, except to the extent you have modified it as allowed under the Apache 2.0 license, and you make it clear that you are the source only of the modification.\n\n  * Combination Marks. Do not use our trademarks in combination with any other marks or logos (for example Foobar Concourse, or the name of your company or product typeset to look like the Concourse logo).\n\n  * Web Tags. Do not use the Concourse trademark in a title or meta tag of a web page to influence search engine rankings or result listings, rather than for discussion or advocacy of the Concourse project.\n\n* PROPER ATTRIBUTION. When you use a Concourse trademark you should include a statement attributing the trademark to Concourse. For example, \"Concourse is a trademark of Concourse in the U.S. and other countries.\"\n\n* MORE QUESTIONS?
