We would love to hear how you got started with Concourse, the type of pipelines you're building, or any tips \u0026 tricks that you can share with the community.\n\n* Answer questions about Concourse in the Support section of our forums or on Stack Overflow\n\nAs you become more comfortable with Concourse, you might be interested in contributing to Concourse's development: * Review issues and report bugs in the concourse/concourse repo. We are by no means experts in every subject area; it sometimes takes us while to understand a problem space well enough to figure out things fit into Concourse's puritanical world. You can help us by: * Voting for issues by adding an emoji reaction to the issue\n\n  * Submitting new bugs when you run into a new problem with Concourse\n\n  * Review GitHub issues submitted by other members of the community; ask for (or provide!) clarification when necessary. A lot of the issues that come in are simply unclear and we end up spending a lot of time on clarifying issues.\n\n* Writing Documentation for the project. You can get started by reviewing the docs code at concourse/docs and making PRs against the project.\n\n* Contributing Code. If you're interested in contributing some work to the core project, you can get started by reviewing the CONTRIBUTING.md getting started guide.

Concourse pipelines represent a dependency flow, kind of like distributed Makefiles. Pipelines are designed to be self-contained so as to minimize server-wide configuration. Maximizing portability also mitigates risk, making it easier for projects to recover from CI disasters.\n\nResources like the git resource and s3 resource are used to express source code, dependencies, deployments, and any other external state. This interface is also used to model more abstract things like scheduled or interval triggers, via the time resource.\n\nResource Types are defined as part of the pipeline itself, making the pipelines more self-contained and keeping Concourse itself small and generic without resorting to a complicated plugin system.\n\nJobs are sequences get, put, and task steps to execute. These steps determine the job's inputs and outputs. Jobs are designed to be idempotent and loosely coupled, allowing the pipeline to grow with the project's needs without requiring engineers to keep too much in their head at a time.\n\nEverything in Concourse runs in a container. Instead of modifying workers to install build tools, Tasks describe their own container image (typically using Docker images via the registry-image resource).\n\n...What?\n\nConcourse admittedly has a steeper learning curve at first, and depending on your background it might be a lot to take in.

This number was chosen arbitrarily and may be reduced in the future. It's important to note that the collector must be able to run frequently enough to not be outpaced by the workload producing things, and so the batch operation should be able to complete pretty quickly.\n\nThe batch operation first performs garbage collection within the database alone, removing rows that are no longer needed. The removal of rows from one stage will often result in removals in a later stage.  They are run in the following order:\n\n* builds that no longer meet the Build Retention criteria are marked non-interceptible\n\n* workers are stepped through their state machine. Unresponsive workers become STALLED, workers that are RETIRING are deleted once drained, and workers that are LANDING become LANDED once drained.\n\n* build_image_resource_caches are removed for builds that finished over 24 hours ago.\n\n* resource_cache_uses are removed for builds that are no longer interceptible.\n\n* resource_configs that are no longer referenced by a resource_caches (resource_config_id) or a resource_config_check_sessions (resource_config_id) are removed.\n\n* resource_caches that are no longer referenced by a resource_configs (resource_cache_id) or a resource_cache_uses (resource_cache_id) are removed.\n\n* resource_config_check_sessions that have exceeded their resource_config_check_sessions (expires_at) are removed.\n\nIf any of the above operations fail, the garbage collector will just log an error and move on. This is so that failure to collect one class of objects does not prevent everything else from being garbage collected. Failure at any part of the garbage collection is OK; it can just retry on the next pass.\n\nAfter the initial pass of garbage collection in the database, there should now be a set of volumes and containers that meet criteria for garbage collection. These two are a bit more complicated to garbage-collect; they both require talking to a worker, and waiting on a potentially slow delete.\n\nContainers and volumes are the costliest resources consumed by Concourse. There are also many of them created over time as builds execute and pipelines perform their resource checking. Therefore it is important to parallelize this aspect of garbage collection so that one slow delete or one slow worker does not cause them to pile up.\n\nSo, the next two steps are Container Collection and Volume Collection.\n\n","depth":5,"section_tag":"how-it-works"},"http response time":{"location":"metrics.html#http response time","title":"http response time","text":"This metric is emitted for each HTTP request to an ATC (both API and web requests).

The resulting sequence of jobs and resources is a dependency graph that continuously pushes your project forward, from source code to production.\n\nYour pipeline configuration is then visualized in the web UI, taking only one click to get from a red (failed) box to seeing why it failed.\n\nThe visualization also provides a \"gut check\" feedback loop - if it looks wrong, it probably is wrong.\n\nAll administration is done using the fly CLI. The fly set-pipeline command pushes the config up to Concourse. Once it looks good, you can then check the file in to source control. This makes it easy to recover if your Concourse server burns down.\n\nEverything runs in containers, ensuring a clean environment on every run. Each task specifies its own image, giving it full control over its dependencies, rather than managing them on your workers.\n\nThe fly intercept command will pop you right into one of your build's containers, which can be useful for debugging.\n\nThe fly execute command executes a task as a one-off build, with your local changes. This will run your code in exactly the same way it would run in your pipeline, without you having to repeatedly push broken commits until it works. Achieve the fabled green build #1!\n\nWhen a job fails, you can also use fly execute with -j flag to run with the same inputs as the failed job. You can then replace an input with your local changes with -i to test if your fix is valid.\n\nConcourse does not have a complex plugin system. Instead, it has a single strong abstraction.\n\nThe resources section of a pipeline lists Resources, which are abstract external locations where your pipeline will monitor for changes, fetch bits from, and push bits to.\n\nFor example, a resource with type git refers to a git repository, which will be cloned in a get step and pushed to in a put step. Behind the scenes, Concourse will continuously run git fetch to look for new commits that jobs may want to trigger on.\n\nAt its core, though, Concourse knows nothing about Git. It comes with a git resource type out of the box, but you could just as easily bring your own into your pipeline. Resource types are implemented as container images containing scripts - using the docker-image resource type, they can be fetched from a Docker registry.\n\n","depth":0,"section_tag":"index"},"input-name":{"location":"tasks.html#input-name","title":"inputs.name","text":"Required.

This way all existing usage of the time resource don't have to change, and continue to have their own version history, unique to the pipeline resource.\n\nThe time resource opts out of this by configuring unique_version_history: true in its metadata.json - but this is something that only \"core\" resource types can do. We plan on supporting this as part of the Resources v2 RFC.\n\nUsers can also set this value themselves by configuring unique_version_history on the resource type.\n\nAnother case where version history shouldn't be shared is when resources \"automagically\" learn their auth credentials using things like IAM roles. In these cases, the credentials aren't in the source. If version history were to be shared, anyone could configure the same source:, not specifying any credentials, and see the version history discovered by some other pipeline that ran its checks on workers that had access via IAM roles.\n\nFor this reason, any resource types that acquire credentials outside of source: should not share version history.

Alex Suraci, Christopher Brown and Pivotal Software, Inc. (collectively, “Concourse”) owns a number of international trademarks and logos that identify the Concourse community and individual Concourse projects (“Concourse Marks”). These trademarks include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * Words: CONCOURSE\n\n  * Logos: {image: images/trademarks/concourse-black.png}\n\n  This policy outlines Concourse’s policy and guidelines about the use of the Concourse trademarks by members of the Concourse development and user community.\n\n* WHY HAVE TRADEMARK GUIDELINES? The Concourse Marks are a symbol of the quality and community support associated with the Concourse open source software. Trademarks protect not only those using the marks, but the entire community as well. Our community members need to know that they can rely on the quality and capabilities represented by the brand. We also want to provide a level playing field. No one should use the Concourse marks in ways that mislead or take advantage of the community, or make unfair use of the trademarks. Also, use of the Concourse Marks should not be in a disparaging manner because we prefer that our marks not be used to be rude about the Concourse open source project or its members.\n\n* OPEN SOURCE LICENSE VS. TRADEMARKS. The Apache 2.0 license gives you the right to use, copy, distribute and modify the Concourse software. However, open source licenses like the Apache 2.0 license do not address trademarks.  Concourse Marks need to be used in a way consistent with trademark law, and that is why we have prepared this policy – to help you understand what branding is allowed or required when using our software under the Apache license.\n\n* PROPER USE OF THE CONCOURSE MARKS. We want to encourage a robust community for the Concourse open source project. Therefore, you may do any of the following, as long as you do so in a way that does not devalue, dilute, or disparage the Concourse brand. In other words, when you do these things, you should behave responsibly and reasonably in the interest of the community, but you do not need a trademark license from us to do them.\n\n  * Nominative Use. You may engage in “nominative use” of the Concourse name, but this does not allow you to use the logo.  Nominative use is sometimes called “fair use” of a trademark, and does not require a trademark license from us.  Here are examples:\n\n    * You may use the Concourse Marks in connection with development of tools, add-ons, or utilities that are compatible with bit-for-bit identical copies of official Concourse software. For example, if you are developing a Foobar tool for Concourse, acceptable project titles would be “Foobar for Concourse\".\n\n    * You may use the Concourse Marks in connection with your noncommercial redistribution of (1) bit-for-bit identical copies of official Concourse software, and (2) unmodified copies of official Concourse source packages.  For example, if your Foobar product included a full redistribution of official Concourse Software or source code packages: \"Concourse-powered Foobar Product\". We strongly discourage, and likely would consider it a trademark problem, to use a name such as “Concourse Foobar.”\n\n    * If you offer maintenance, support, or hosting services for Concourse software, you may accurately state that in your marketing materials or portfolio, without using the Concourse logo.\n\n    * You may modify the Concourse software and state that your modified software is “based on the Concourse software” or a similar accurate statement, without using the Concourse logo.\n\n    * You may engage in community advocacy. The Concourse software is developed by and for its community. We will allow the use of the word trademark in this context, provided:\n\n      * The trademark is used in a manner consistent with this policy.\n\n      * There is no commercial purpose behind the use.\n\n      * There is no suggestion that your project is approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Concourse.\n\n      * User or Development Groups. You may create Concourse user or development groups, and publicize meetings or discussions for those groups.\n\n  * Attribution. Identify the trademarks as trademarks of Concourse, as set forth in Section 7.\n\n  * Redistribution of Binaries. If you redistribute binaries that you have downloaded from the Concourse repository, you should retain the logos and name of the product.  However, if you make any changes to the binaries (other than configuration or installation changes that do not involve changes to the source code), or if you re-build binaries from our source code, you should not use our logos.  Our logos represent our quality control, so they should be retained where the product has been built by us, but not otherwise.\n\n  * Capitalization. “Concourse” should always be capitalized and one word.\n\n  * Adjectives. Use the Concourse mark as an adjective, not a noun or verb.\n\n* IMPROPER USE OF THE TRADEMARKS AND LOGOS. Use of the logo is reserved solely for use by Concourse in its unaltered form. Examples of unauthorized use of the Concourse trademarks include:\n\n  * Commercial Use: You may not use the Concourse Marks in connection with commercial redistribution of Concourse software (commercial redistribution includes, but is not limited to, redistribution in connection with any commercial business activities or revenue-generating business activities) regardless of whether the Concourse software is unmodified.\n\n  * Entity Names. You may not form a company, use a company name, or create a software product name that includes the “Concourse” trademark, or implies any foundational or authorship role. If you have a software product that works with Concourse, it is suggested you use terms such as ‘\u003cproduct name\u003e for Concourse’ or ‘\u003cproduct name\u003e, Concourse Edition.” If you wish to form an entity for a user or developer group, please contact us and we will be glad to discuss a license for a suitable name.\n\n  * Class or Quality. You may not imply that you are providing a class or quality of Concourse (e.g., \"enterprise-class\" or \"commercial quality\") in a way that implies Concourse is not of that class, grade or quality, nor that other parties are not of that class, grade, or quality.\n\n  * Combinations. Use of the Concourse Marks to identify software that combines any portion of the Concourse software with any other software, unless the combined distribution is an official Concourse distribution. For example, you may not distribute a combination of the Concourse  software with software released by the Foobar project under the name “Concourse Foobar Distro”.\n\n  * False or Misleading Statements. You may not make false or misleading statements regarding your use of Concourse (e.g., \"we wrote the majority of the code\" or \"we are major contributors\" or \"we are committers\").\n\n  * Domain Names. You must not use Concourse or any confusingly similar phrase in a domain name. For instance “www.concoursehost.com” is not allowed.  If you wish to use such a domain name for a non-commercial user or developer group to engage in community advocacy, please contact us and we will be glad to discuss a license for a suitable domain name.  Because of the many persons who, unfortunately, seek to spoof, swindle or deceive the community by using confusing domain names, we must be very strict about this rule.\n\n  * Merchandise. You must not manufacture, sell or give away merchandise items, such as T-shirts and mugs, bearing the Concourse logo, or create any mascot for the project. If you wish to use the logo to do this for a non-commercial user or developer group to engage in community advocacy, please contact us and we will be glad to discuss a license to do this.\n\n  * Variations, takeoffs or abbreviations. You may not use a variation of the Concourse name or logo for any purpose other than common usage of these in community communications. For example, the following are not acceptable:\n\n    * CONCRSE\n\n    * MyConcourse\n\n    * ConcourseDBX\n\n    * ConcourseHost\n\n    * ConcourseGuru\n\n  * Endorsement or Sponsorship. You may not use the Concourse trademarks in a manner that would imply Concourse’s affiliation with or endorsement, sponsorship, or support of a product or service.\n\n  * Rebranding. You may not change the trademark on unmodified Concourse software to your own brand.  You may not hold yourself out as the source of the Concourse software, except to the extent you have modified it as allowed under the Apache 2.0 license, and you make it clear that you are the source only of the modification.\n\n  * Combination Marks. Do not use our trademarks in combination with any other marks or logos (for example Foobar Concourse, or the name of your company or product typeset to look like the Concourse logo).\n\n  * Web Tags. Do not use the Concourse trademark in a title or meta tag of a web page to influence search engine rankings or result listings, rather than for discussion or advocacy of the Concourse project.\n\n* PROPER ATTRIBUTION. When you use a Concourse trademark you should include a statement attributing the trademark to Concourse. For example, \"Concourse is a trademark of Concourse in the U.S. and other countries.\"\n\n* MORE QUESTIONS?

Unfortunately to implement this there's a massive database migration. Expect anywhere from a few minutes of downtime up to a few hours when you upgrade to this version, depending on how many builds you have and how chatty they are. Sorry about that.\n\nThere is no way of predicting how long this migration may take for your instance. It depends on the chattiness of your builds and the performance of your database. For a rough approximation: running the migration on the Concourse team's server took 20 minutes to migrate 13 million build events.\n\nYou can find out how many build events you have by running the following query against your Concourse database:\n\nSELECT relname, n_live_tup\nFROM pg_stat_user_tables\nWHERE relname = 'build_events';\nThe root of the issue is the amount of data in the build_events table. If you don't have many build logs then then you can probably just upgrade and not worry about the rest of this. If the upgrade is going to take too long then you'll need to find some way to reduce the rows in that table.\n\nBefore you delete any data from the system you should make sure to take a backup of your database and make doubly sure you can restore it while blind-folded and upside-down in case anything goes wrong.\n\nIf you don't care about your old build logs then you can simply run TRUNCATE build_events; before upgrading and the migration will be quick and painless.\n\nMany of you probably do care about your build events but maybe only those which were created in the past X months. If this sounds like a good idea then have I got the SQL query for you! Run this against your Concourse database (change the X to the number of months you'd like to keep):\n\nDELETE FROM build_events\nWHERE build_id IN (\n  SELECT builds.id\n  FROM jobs JOIN builds ON jobs.id = builds.job_id\n  WHERE builds.end_time \u003c NOW() - INTERVAL 'X month'\n  ORDER BY builds.id\n);\nThis query may take a while to execute but your Concourse can be online the entire time that it is running.\n\nIf you want to keep all of your build logs and have a fast migration then I'm sorry, I can't help you. :( Maybe upgrade over a weekend?\n\nThe Docker Image resource no longer produces the docker saved image by default. This is to reduce disk usage when using the resource as an image_resource. You must now pass save: true as part of params on the get step to produce the image file.\n\nInputs to jobs that are not configured to trigger the job when new versions appear will now be rendered with a dashed line. This makes it easier to see which resources automate the pipeline flow, and which jobs are only ever manually triggered.\n\nA pending build will now indicate why it's pending, via a checklist that appears at the top of the build output.

But let us know if you have any major problems with it.\n\nImproved the caching of resources used for image_resource. Previously if the same version was fetched multiple times on the same worker, we'd keep all of them around so long as they were the latest version. We'll now only keep one.\n\nThe fly destroy-pipeline command learnt the -n option which when used will not ask you to confirm the deletion of the pipeline. Useful for scripts. Dangerous for users.\n\nThe Docker Image resource no longer worked for images configured with ENTRYPOINTs as of v0.72.0, and ended up running whatever the entrypoint was, with our internal binary tool as an argument. It now works again. Our bad.\n\nThe GitHub release resource would have issues when fetching artefacts from S3 via GitHub when using an access token. It no longer has these issues.\n\nThe Docker Image resource now supports a dockerfile parameter for specifying a path to the Dockerfile to use.\n\nThe Git resource now supports producing annotated tags via the annotate parameter.\n\nThe Git resource now supports checking for tag patterns like *-production via the tag_filter source configuration.\n\nThe Git resource now includes git lfs.\n\n","depth":2,"section_tag":"v0730"},"v0740":{"location":"download.html#v0740","title":"v0.74.0","text":"You can now configure resource types in your pipeline rather than redeploying your workers with additional resource types.

This user will also be used when hijacking in to a build container.\n\nHijacked connections will no longer cause connection timeouts at interim load balancers if there is no input or output.\n\nThe pipeline graph rendering now has large portions of the computation cached. This should provide a significant speedup and decrease in CPU load when viewing a pipeline.\n\nWe've made some tweaks to the ATC's build scheduling that should fix \"deadlock\" scenarios with serial groups.\n\nPreviously, if a pipeline of \"A -\u003e B -\u003e C\" had all 3 jobs in a serial group, and the builds were enqueued in order of C, B, then A (manually), nothing could ever run, as the scheduling was based on the order of the builds being enqueued, and C would never be satisifed. This is now fixed by collecting inputs and then scheduling only once they're available, so that C never gets scheduled, and so A is able to be scheduled, followed by B, and then C.\n\nThe icon font that was broken in Safari by v0.73.0 are now unbroken by v0.74.0.\n\nInterrupting a fly execute that was fetching outputs will no longer panic if you cancel it in the middle.\n\nIf you try and trigger a build while you are not logged in then we'll now redirect you back to the build page you were on rather than the main pipeline page.\n\nThe Pool resource will now ignore in-place modifications when working out if a log aquisition is still valid.\n\nThe fly CLI will now print the target it will be interacting with at the start of every command.\n\nThe fly CLI default value of the -t flag has been removed.

This should dramatically reduce disk usage on your workers, as there's no longer a redundant copy from importing the image into Garden's graph, as long as you're using image_resource. This also means we're now using btrfs for the whole stack, which makes running Docker in Concourse tasks much easier.\n\nAs part of this, the binary distribution no longer supports image in the task config.

Newly configured pipelines are hidden by default, and all existing pipelines will be hidden upon upgrade, so make sure to expose the ones you intend to be public!\n\n* Many API routes now require the team to specified in the URL, e.g. /api/v1/teams/foo/pipelines. Our API still not yet an official interface to Concourse; we continue to encourage using fly until we turn it into a properly versioned and documented API.\n\n  The web UI routes now also have the team name in them.

Its button in the header was taking up valuable UI space, so we unceremoniously demoted it.\n\nMany of you feel bad for this page.  That is because you crazy. It has no feelings! fly builds is much better.\n\nBefore we kill it off completely, we'll make sure fly builds does everything you'd need from the page, which is really just a matter of having a column for the build URL so you can view it in the web UI. Aside from that, fly builds is better in every way: if your next step is fly intercept, it keeps you in the terminal. You can also change the number of results with -c, and filter it to a job with -j, both of which should be much faster for finding what you're looking for.\n\nThe favicon will now change color when viewing a build to reflect its status.

For real.\n\n* If you configured days and start and stop, the days would be treated as UTC, rather than respecting the timezone in start or stop. What's more, start and stop could be emitted, leaving there no place for a location for the days to even be specified.\n\n  We've added a location field, which should be used instead of embedded offsets, and then days will respect it.\n\nThe BOSH release will now leave 10GB of space free for the system, rather than allocating all of it for BaggageClaim. This is mainly to make the failure mode better. Without this overhead, BaggageClaim would fill up the host's disk, then fail to write to that, and then panic and go read-only, making it unrecoverable.

The Golang library had a logic error that led to a deadlock during this key negotiation. This led to the connection being \"alive\" but with the SSH server no longer able to transfer data to and from the worker. This meant API calls would hang, and the worker would eventually unregister as it would fail to heartbeat.

You may want to upgrade them first, actually. If you don't the builds will go orange. But maybe you don't care. Read on for more info.\n\n{image: images/life.gif}\n\nMany many moons ago, in the year 2016, we embarked on a noble goal of refactoring how we do, like, everything. The issue started as More explicit worker, container, volume lifecycles, and came to be known simply as \"life\". There were many puns. They were great at first. But some people took them too far. @joshzarrabi.\n\nAnyway, we're done now.\n\nWith this upgrade, you should notice an overall reduction in container and volume counts across your workers. You should also see a substantial decrease in database queries to Postgres and network calls to Garden and BaggageClaim, as all the container and volume heartbeating is now gone.\n\nIf you're interested in the refactor, read on.\n\nThe general idea is to switch away from creating containers and volumes willy-nilly and nagging the worker every 30 seconds to keep them around. Instead, we create containers and volumes that are associated to a richer schema such that we don't have to keep heartbeating and know exactly when it should go away. So to keep something like a cache around indefinitely, we just don't destroy it, rather than pinging it all the time.\n\nBuilding on the richer schema, we are also more able to determine when we can re-use a container. For example, if you have the same exact resource configured across 10 pipelines, that will result in only one check container, rather than 10. This is because there's an abstract notion of a nameless \"resource config\". We still create one container per team so that fly intercept can't break an entire resource's checking in a multi-tenant environment.\n\nWe'll also explicitly remove containers and volumes, rather than relying on Garden and BaggageClaim to kill them once we stop caring about them. This will surface failures to delete in a way that's much easier to notice. This also means that if the ATC goes away for 5 minutes, all its containers and volumes stick around, rather than being mercilessly killed.\n\nA design document for all this will be forthcoming.\n\nWorkers are now versioned. This will allow the ATC to ignore workers that are too old if it requires a new feature or protocol change. The fly workers command will now show the version of each worker and warn you if any are out of date.\n\nAny existing workers you have will be ignored until they are upgraded, so if you upgrade your ATC first, builds that are in flight will fail to resume. If you upgrade the workers first, though, the builds will probably succeed.\n\nIn a task config, you used to be able to configure a URI specifying the rootfs for the underlying container via a config known as \"the other image, like, the one you should never use\".\n\nWe renamed it to something more descriptive and harder to confuse with \"the good image, like, the one you should use\": rootfs_uri.\n\nWhen fly intercepting a task that uses image_resource, you will no longer be prompted to intercept the check and get containers for its image. You probably never actually wanted to do that so it was more annoying than helpful. This is something that we got for free as part of the life refactor.\n\nSupport for web hooks has landed, thanks to a PR from @mainephd with help from @billimek and others! This was a long-awaited feature that should make many GitHub Enterprise admins very happy.\n\nThis feature is implemented in a way that requires no changes from any resources - it \"just works\". There's no special integration with GitHub, BitBucket, or any hosted offering; you just configure webhook_token in your resource and pass the hook URL to your service.\n\nBuilding on our fancy new schema, we now make sure to keep the image used by a one-off build around for 24 hours. Previously it would expire, like, whenever. I don't know man. It works now.\n\nWe've refactored how auth providers are configured such that all code for a given provider can be defined within a single package. Providers also have an interface to fill out that should cover everything a provider needs to do. This should make it easier (and safer) to submit PRs for auth providers.\n\nThe TSA can now be configured with multiple ATC API endpoints to register with, for HA.\n\nFixed a UI quirk with the sidebar in Firefox, thanks to a PR by @archSeer!\n\nWhen a resource is failing to check for a meta-level thing like not being able to create its container, the error will now be surfaced in the UI, thanks to a PR by @davidje13!\n\nThe docker-image resource now uses Docker v17.05.0-ce, which notably includes support for multi-stage builds!\n\nBaggageClaim will now do more efficient copying on Windows, thanks to a PR by @jdeppe-pivotal!\n\nThe s3 resource can now upload files larger than 5MB to GCS, thanks to a PR by @ljfranklin!

We've been wanting to do this for a while for security reasons (especially in the context of custom resource types), but we ended up needing to do it anyway as part of the change to overlay (two release notes down), in kind of a roundabout way.\n\nTo make a custom resource type privileged, configure privileged: true.\n\nThis change should only require action from folks using a custom resource type that actually has depended on being privileged, such as any forks of the docker-image resource. It may be that you (or the resource author) will not know this until it fails. Resource authors are encouraged to update their READMEs if their resource type does indeed need it.\n\nThis was motivated by the one downside of overlay that we encountered: namespacing a volume takes much longer. Namespacing a volume means re-mapping its files to have UIDs that correspond to the correct UIDs for its target container's user namespace. This typically a recursive chown that remaps host-side UID 0 to the container's equivalent (UID 4 billion something), or vice-versa.\n\nNamespacing a volume takes longer for overlay because a chown of a file necessitates copying the file to the upper layer, which takes time and space. This did not affect btrfs as the nature of its copy-on-write mechanism is vastly different.\n\nMost workloads should be unprivileged, so to optimize for that, we've made all resources unprivileged by default. This means that they generate unprivileged volumes which won't need to be namespaced for unprivileged tasks (and other resources, i.e. put).\n\nPipeline config and team auth settings can now be encrypted in the database. See Encryption for more information.\n\nThis is the first step towards a better security model around credential management. The next step will be to externalize credentials entirely to a credential manager such as Vault or CredHub.\n\nWorkers will now use overlay rather than btrfs as their filesystem of choice for BaggageClaim.\n\nIf you're morbidly curious about all the low-level mumbo jumbo that went into this venture, check out issue concourse #1045.\n\nIf you don't really care, know that upon upgrade the workers will stick with btrfs, for backwards-compatibility. It is only on recreate that they will pick overlay, and only if it makes sense to (i.e. your kernel version is \u003e 4.0, and your disk is not formatted as btrfs already).\n\nThere are many benefits to what sounds like a low-level change:\n\n* No more loopback shenanigans. Most of you aren't using btrfs as your disk's filesystem, so Concourse would always have to make a sparse file and mount a loopback device over it. This was just confusing and made disk usage hard to interpret, and possibly leak.\n\n* No more locked-up workers! Many users, including us, encountered a btrfs bug which led to reads and writes of the disk locking up. The only way out from this was to recreate the worker.\n\n* Concourse in Docker for Mac should now work! They had btrfs stripped out of the kernel image, so Concourse had to fall back on the naive driver, which is hella slow.\n\n* A noticeable performance boost under load. In our testing, overlay performs better under realstic work loads like building many Docker images at once. While overlay would edge out btrfs at low contention, it performed even better as we ramped up the concurrency. What took btrfs 10 minutes would take overlay around 7.\n\n  Also worth noting is that during testing we could pretty reliably get btrfs to lock up. It actually made it hard to collect enough data.

As part of this, we've removed the --tsa-port flag and changed --tsa-host to instead take a host:port. (Because TECHNICALLY, they could be on different ports.)\n\nWe've revamped how fly execute gets its inputs and outputs to/from the build, so that configuring the ATC: web UI \u0026 build scheduler with an external URL is no longer required.

You should probably just skip straight to v3.8.0.\n\nWe've ripped out the old \u0026 janky PostgreSQL job from our Concourse BOSH release. You will have no choice but to bring your own PostgreSQL database.\n\nIf you use the Concourse BOSH release and you haven't upgraded in a while, I'd suggest you check out the previous migration instructions from Concourse v3.5.0 and v3.6.0.\n\nWe've changed how we develop database migrations, so as to support down migrations in the future. This will hopefully mean that if you upgrade Concourse and for whatever reason need to back out, you'll be able to, instead of being stuck on a (possibly broken) latest version.\n\nAs part of this switch, we've also squashed our migrations into one big bang, which should also improve startup time for fresh installations. However, this means that you must first upgrade to v3.6.0 before upgrading to v3.7.0!\n\nSo, do that. You may need to anyway now that we've removed PostgreSQL (see previous note).\n\nThere are new required manifest changes to deploy this release with BOSH.\n\nOur BOSH release used to have a few magical mystical packages called generated_something. These packages would generate a RSA key every time they compiled, in service of automagically wiring up security credentials so you didn't have to put them in your manifest.\n\nThis approach was extremely clever and whoever came up with the idea was a downright genius, way ahead of their time.\n\nWe've now collectively decided that the whole approach is stupid and redundant now that BOSH manifests can generate their own typed variables. It was fun while it lasted.\n\nWhat you need to do for this change is described in concourse #1834. You can consult our changes to manifests/single-vm.yml for reference.\n\nAs an alternative to hand-editing your manifest, the next release note may pique your interest.\n\nWe have started dusting off concourse-deployment and using it as a central location for Concourse BOSHy deployment goodness. We now use it for our production deployment, as well as a few testing environments.\n\nWe are now openly gathering feedback on one of our worst-kept-secrets: the Concourse dashboard view. You can access it by visiting /beta/dashboard.\n\nIn this version of Concourse, we've tweaked some of the visual elements of the dashboard to make it more readible for installations with multiple teams. We've also fixed some of the pipeline states so that they make more sense.\n\nTell us what you think about the new dashboard by dropping us a line on concourse #1829.\n\nThe fly execute command will now default to -x, which has been replaced with a new flag, --include-ignored, to revert to the old behavior.\n\nIn addition, Fly will no longer blow up when trying to execute with an input that doesn't have a .gitignore. It will also not blow up if any inputs are files and not directories.\n\nThe ATC will now use a separate database connection pool for the API and the pipeline scheduling work. This will make it so that a bunch of slow API requests can't starve critical functionality.\n\nPipeline-provided resource types will no longer fail miserably for a minute or two when they're first configured.\n\nYou can now configure params on a pipeline resource type, thanks to a PR by @jghiloni! This will enable users to use the s3 resource with params: {unpack: true}, as an alternative to the docker-image resource.\n\nYou can now specify a on_abort hook on a step or on a job. It will run on abort. 🎉\n\nThe ATC can now be configured with a pure-random worker selection strategy, which may help users affected by our default resource affinity placement, which can result in overloaded workers.

This feature took a lot of thought, trial and error, and shaking our fists at each Linux distribution maintainer for having a different approach to how certificates are stored and managed. There's a lot of context for this in concourse #1027.\n\nLong story short, we wanted a way for certificate management to be done generically across all resources, so that resource authors don't have to keep implementing various forms of ca_certs, insecure_skip_verify, etc., and things can \"just work\" securely by default.\n\nThis feature is enabled by default for our BOSH distribution.

(Read on before upgrading - this is a huge change and there are some unsupported migration paths.)\n\nIn contrast to previous releases of Concourse, users are now central to the authentication flow. Instead of logging in as a team, you now log in as a user and can belong to one or more teams. Users can be added to a team by configuring the team's whitelist as described in Configuring Auth.\n\nThis is the first step on our march towards full role-based access control. Help us plan that out by checking out the RFC!\n\nIn addition, it is now much easier to extend Concourse to support more providers. We're leveraging CoreOS's Dex project for all the moving parts, which already supports a ton of providers (Dex calls them \"connectors\"). The only delta required for Concourse to support a Dex connector is a tiny bit of glue code in our new Skymarshal component to provide higher-level flags for our CLI.\n\nThis was a large change and it was pretty difficult to make backwards-compatible. Here's what's \"breaking\":\n\n* There are different flags to pass to the binary distribution, and the BOSH deployment requires manifest changes. Consult Configuring Auth for more information for the binaries, and the Concourse BOSH deployment repo for BOSH.\n\n* There is no support for configuring the same provider multiple times (say, multiple GitHub Enterprise instances). The migration will fail when trying to upgrade an instance with teams having different configurations for the same provider.\n\n  At the moment, you'll have to deploy multiple Concourse instances. This may be something we can support in the future.\n\n* There is no longer support for BitBucket auth. Sorry - Dex doesn't support it. :( However we do support generic LDAP, oAuth, and OIDC connectors, which you may be able to use instead.\n\n* If you have multiple teams configured with the same basic auth username, the migration will fail. This is because \"basic auth\" is now gone and in its place is local user configuration. Logging in with basic auth is now actually logging in as the configured user, so there can't be multiple.\n\n* The flags for fly set-team have been split between set-team and concourse web (because part of the config is now global).\n\n* You may also need to download and install the latest 4.0.0 fly CLI. In the past you would have been able to fly sync your way to the latest version of fly but the new auth in 4.0.0 will cause the old fly to error out.\n\nYou should definitely check for these conditions and take a database backup before attempting the upgrade. In practice, our two largest environments upgraded just fine with no intervention required, but if you're not sure, it can't hurt to be careful.\n\nThanks to Dex, we now also support LDAP based auth!\n\nThe fly teams command only lists teams of which you are a member (or all teams, if you're a member of the admin team).\n\nYou can also pass -d/--details to show each team's auth config! This should make it a lot easier to check if the auth setup is correct when someone complains about not being able to log in.\n\nOwing to the auth revamp, the fly set-team command no longer takes flags for the provider configuration (so no client IDs/secrets/etc.). This, in combination with the previous feature, should make tweaking the auth config a lot easier.\n\nThe dashboard's influence has taken hold on the web UI! The main page (/) now shows the dashboard instead of some random pipeline configured by the first team on the instance. We've also made the dashboard more powerful with pipeline pausing and re-ordering. We hope you like it because we've removed the sidebar from the pipeline view...it's just cleaner.\n\nWe've also spread the colour scheme to the rest of the UI and changed the font everywhere to Inconsolata.\n\nWe've made significant improvements to the performance of the build page while keeping its functionality exactly the same.\n\nSee this GitHub comment for the nitty-gritty!\n\nThere's still more work that could be done, and we put some planning on the issue, but we figured a 6.5x improvement is a good start so we can get back to big juicy features like space. If it's still not fast enough for you, we could really use your help! We're happy to provide guidance for anyone looking to contribute.\n\nPreviously, if a resource was only ever used as an explicit output of a job, it would always show up as black even if it was erroring. It will now show up as orange, like the other resources.\n\nWe've updated some of the messaging in the UI to be less confusing. When viewing a build that has not been made public it'll now say you're not authorized, rather than telling you to log in, only to tell you to log in again, because that didn't change anything.\n\nWhen we redid the container lifecycle way back in v3.0.0, one side effect was that containers failed one-off builds would be garbage collected almost immediately, making it pretty difficult to debug (you'd pretty much have to hijack while it was running).\n\nThanks to a PR from @databus23, there is now a configurable \"grace period\" after which these containers will be garbage collected! The flag is --gc-one-off-grace-period on the concourse web command, and it defaults to 5 minutes.\n\nWe fixed a regression with the CredHub integration that caused very high CPU usage on the ATC. In addition, we've bumped our CredHub client to include a fix PRed by @takeyourhatoff which even further reduces CPU usage. Yay!\n\nThe interval on which resource types are checked for new versions can now be set globally via --resource-type-checking-interval, or per-resource-type in a pipeline via check_every.\n\nWe fixed a couple situations in the UI where jobs or pipelines with spaces in their name would render incorrectly. (Please don't do this though. It looks so weird and just makes the CLI hard to use! We may have to tighten up naming restrictions in the future, and keeping spaces is pretty low priority. Let us know if you have a real good reason though.)\n\nClicking the pipeline in the breadcrumb while already on the pipeline page (but viewing a particular group) will now reset the pipeline to the \"initial\" view. This way it behaves like a normal link.\n\nRepeated team and pipeline creation and destruction would leave a few tables around: team_build_events_XXX and pipeline_build_events_XXX. This would cause the database to increase in CPU usage over time.\n\nWe now ensure these tables get cleaned up via database triggers on pipeline/team deletion. However, we decided against writing a migration to automatically clean up existing orphaned tables because, well, it felt scary and dangerous.\n\nIf you are seeing symptoms of this problem, it should be safe to manually drop the tables that have no corresponding pipeline or team. We just didn't want to be responsible for a migration that had a high chance of data bloodlust. This way it can be your fault instead of ours!\n\nWe've made quite a few optimizations that should take a lot of load off the database. This should improve everything from garbage collection efficiency to web UI response time.\n\nThe Vault credential manager backend can now cache credentials based on their lease duration. This was a big chunk of work and should make Vault operators' lives a bit easier. To enable this feature, pass --vault-cache to concourse web. Thanks @rfliam for the PR!\n\nAs a side note, we're in need of someone to champion the next phase of credential manager support. We've collected feedback from our first (very much MVP) implementation but really need individuals who have experience with each backend to take the next step. See rfcs #5 for more information!\n\nWhen running on Windows, we will no longer shell out to tar for performing volume streaming operations, since it seems to be pretty unreliable. A native Go implementation will be used instead, which is a bit slower but much more portable. Thanks for the PR, @ankeesler!\n\nThe The fly CLI now supports --json on most commands to dump info in JSON format, rather than the human-friendly table format.\n\nRecent versions of Docker introduced an issue where dockerd could fail to start if the worker was under load. This resulted in an infinite loop in the docker-image resource.\n\nWe've made the resource more resilient to this - it'll detect a failure to start and keep resuscitating dockerd until it starts, giving up after 2 minutes.\n\nThe s3 resource now supports skip_download: true, thanks to a PR by @talset!\n\nThe BOSH release now has properties for configuring the DataDog metrics emitter, thanks to @SHyx0rmZ!\n\nWe've split the migration operations out into a separate subcommand: concourse migrate. This is just a bit easier to reason about rather than having all the options baked in to the same command that runs the ATC, and also lets you run migrations without passing all the other flags required by concourse web.\n\nThe Prometheus metrics will now automatically prune stale workers, thanks to a PR by @databus23!\n\nThe Prometheus metrics for pipeline scheduling are now counters instead of gauges, thanks to a PR by @databus23!\n\nThere are now metrics emitted for peridoc resource checking, thanks to a PR by @databus23!\n\nFixed handling of no_proxy in concourse worker, thanks to a PR by @databus23!\n\nThe docker-image resource now includes support for fetching and extracting xz packages in ADD commands, thanks to a PR by @et7peho.\n\nThe cf resource now supports no_start: true, thanks to a PR by @klakin-pivotal!\n\nThe docker-image resource now has a tag_file param which deprecates the old tag command which does the same thing.

We opted to make the icon yellow instead of highlighting the background as we were quickly approaching 50 Shades of Grey.\n\nWe've fixed a scary container snowballing failure mode that could happen when check containers failed to create. This was a somewhat hairy bug; see concourse #2454 for more information.\n\nResources can now be pinned across the pipeline as part of the pipeline config by specifying version on the resource definition in the pipeline. This is analogous to setting version on every get step that references the resource.\n\nPipeline credentials can now be verified via a new --check-creds flag available on fly set-pipeline. This will simply try fetching all of them from the configured credential manager, and let you know which ones couldn't be interpolated. Thanks for the PRs, @edtan!\n\nThe git resource is now smart enough to handle shallow clones while still being able to fetch commits that would not normally be included by the configured depth. This should make configuring depth: 1 safe, so we've removed the condescending warning from the README. Thanks for the PR, @norbertbuchmueller!\n\nThe ATC now exposes an API endpoint for performing a health-check against the configured credential manager, at /api/v1/info/creds. It'll propagate whatever information may be useful, depending on your credential manager backend. Note that this endpoint is only accessible by admin users (members of the main team).\n\nWhen logging in to The fly CLI, if you're already logged in via the web UI it'll just shimmy the existing token over to fly rather than requiring you to go through the login flow all over again.\n\nThis also fixes the annoying behavior of having to log back in to the web UI whenever logging in to fly. Huzzah!\n\nWe gave up on using third-party Go migration libraries and wrote our own. This should make failed migrations a lot easier to troubleshoot and recover from. All of our migrations run in transactions, so there's no more confusing \"dirty\" state, and failed migrations will record the failure error in the database.\n\nWe'll be extracting this package from the ATC soon as a proper library.\n\nPreviously Concourse would allow you to configure arbitrary params in a pipeline, even if the task file itself didn't configure them. This was confusing as it meant the tasks could not be trusted to describe all their required parameters.\n\nConcourse will now emit a warning to the task logs upon noticing this. A future release will turn this into an error. Thanks for the PR, @edtan!\n\nSearching on the dashboard will now live-update the URL bar, making it easy to copy-paste and share the search with your best friends. Thanks for the PR, @SHyx0rmZ!\n\nPreviously, when searching something on the dashboard that filtered out all the pipelines for a given team, the UI showed messaging that made it look like the team had no pipelines at all, when in reality they just didn't match your search terms. Now the UI will just hide the teams entirely!\n\nThe fly validate-pipeline can now be instructed to print the interpolated pipeline config via --output. Thanks for the PR, @henderjm!\n\nThe BOSH release now exposes properties for configuring LDAP auth, thanks to a PR by @JamesClonk!\n\nAll our auth CA certificate properties were broken - they were type: certificate but didn't actually pluck the certificate part off of the property. They're now fixed thanks to a PR by @ArthurHlt.\n\nIf this was working for you before, you'll have to change your manifest such that the properties specified conform to the BOSH certificate type - so you'll just need to take the existing value and nest it under certificate:.\n\nThe TSA will now respect the configured log level for worker heartbeating logs, thanks to a PR by @edtan.\n\nWe got rid of a ton of annoying and chatty logs from the TSA:\n\n* closing-channel\n\n* closing-forwarded-tcpip\n\n* waiting-for-tcpip-io\n\n* done-waiting\n\nThese were useful a long while back as it's fairly tricky to implement a TCP/IP-forwarding SSH server. But now it pretty much works and it was like printing a long line for breathing in and another for breathing out.\n\nThe docker-image resource will now fail more betterly when the build_args_file can't be parsed. Thanks @ghostsquad!\n\nThe docker-image resource will now forego starting the Docker daemon if skip_download: true is set. Thanks @norbertbuchmueller!\n\n@petrosagg a few places where Concourse couldn't compile on 32-bit platforms. See concourse #1379 for more information!\n\nThe bosh-io-release resource now supports configuring a version regexp by which to filter detected versions, thanks to a PR by @dark5un!\n\nThe OIDC auth method now supports being configured with a whitelist of Google hosted domains, thanks to a PR by @rubenv!\n\nThe search field on the dashboard will now live-update the URL, making it easy to share and bookmark pre-set filters. Thanks for the PR, @SHyx0rmZ!\n\nThe s3 resource can now be used with Dell's EMC ECS object store, thanks to a fix by @adam-power!\n\nThe docker-image resource will now fail with a clearer error when your ECR credentials are incorrect, thanks to a PR by @GrantSheehan!\n\nThe docker-image resource now supports interpolating the Concourse-provided env vars in build args, thanks to a PR by @norbertbuchmueller!\n\nThe git resource is now rocking the latest and greatest version of Git LFS, thanks to a PR by @alucillo!\n\nWe went ahead and started using ON CONFLICT in more places where we were sorely needing safe upsert mechanics prior to our bump to Postgres 9.5. Database integrity is cool and deserves to be release notes! Don't @ me.\n\nBuilding a precompiled BOSH release has been fixed. One of our Windows packages was missing the exiter.ps1 short-circuit in its spec. Thanks for the PR, @RomRider!\n\nThe git resource will now emit a short SHA to .git/short_ref, which can be useful for dynamic tagging and such. Thanks for the PR, @suda!\n\nThe s3 resource now supports skip_download: true in params.\n\nThe cf resource now supports configuring vars and vars_files, thanks to a PR by @jmcarp!\n\nThe cf resource now configures env under each application in the manifest, rather than at the top level (which is deprecated). Thanks for the PR, @jmcarp!\n\nClarified the help-text for local user configuration to mention that the password can be in plaintext, and if bcrypted it must have a minimum cost of 10.\n\nFixed a faulty default resulting in borked garbage collection on BOSH deployed workers that are configured to forward through the TSA: worker registration \u0026 forwarding (they would try to reach the instance IP rather than 127.0.0.1).\n\nFixed in-place upgrades of binary-deployed workers. Previously registration would fail with a confusing message saying something like \"base resource type already exists.\"\n\n","depth":2,"section_tag":"v410"},"v420":{"location":"download.html#v420","title":"v4.2.0","text":"{image: images/vapenaysh.png}\n\nFixed a potential information leak: when logged in and viewing a resource from some other team's (exposed) pipeline, you can no longer view the resource's check error, as it may unintentionally have sensitive info in the output. This regressed in v4.0.0.\n\nThe dashboard view will now indicate whether you are a member of each team or whether you're only seeing it because it has exposed pipelines.\n\nThe Running a web node can now be configured to periodically emit build logs to a syslog endpoint! This is configured via --syslog-X flags on the concourse web command. When enabled, build logs will be shipped off in batch as builds complete.\n\nIn v4.1.0 we accidentally broke support for --postgres-data-source. This flag has been deprecated ever since v2.7.2 (over a year ago), so we've opted to finally remove it.\n\nWhen we fixed the login bug in v4.1.0 by storing Dex state in the database (rather than in-memory), that effectively made it so that any changes made to auth settings (like local user config, GitHub config, etc) would not take effect.\n\nThis was because prior to the fix we were using an in-memory store, so all we had to do before was create all the configs anew, but now that things persist we have to do a comparison and update/remove things that were changed or removed from the flags. Thankfully @edtan noticed this and fixed it in a PR!\n\nWith switching to Dex for auth in v4.0.0 we ended up using the external URL as part of the internal login flow callbacks. This meant it would break if your external URL could not be reached (perhaps it's behind a reverse proxy with auth, or a self-signed-cert, or a firewall).\n\nThis is now fixed - the callbacks will go to the internal address only. Sorry for the turbulence! A few folks were stuck on this.\n\nThe fly intercept command will no longer list containers that are still being created and are not yet interceptible, which would lead to an unhelpful websocket: bad handshake error.\n\nFixed one more instance where logged-in users would get logged out too soon. Specifically, on first login the cookie would expire in 1 hour rather than 24 hours.\n\nThe root cause of this was silly.\n\nFixed a potential panic in the 'delete worker' API endpoint, which is used internally as part of the worker draining lifecycle.\n\nThe BOSH release now respects the configured postgresql.client_cert property, thanks to a fix by @flavorjones. This broke back in v3.3.0 when we tweaked the type of the property.\n\nRemoved an artificial limit to the garbage collector that was originally to prevent a stampede of work on a single worker. Now that workers garbage-collect themselves, this was no longer necessary, and only slowed down the database side of the garbage collection lifecycle.\n\nCleaned up our idempotent process reattaching mumbo-jumbo to not rely on Garden properties which should help quiet down the Running a worker node logs (from when we check for a property that hasn't yet been set).\n\nFixed a bug that caused the Vault login retry logic to go into a fast loop if retrying failed for long enough to exceed the maximum retry backoff.

You should probably read these release notes in full - there are a ton of substantial new features and a good (bad?) amount of breaking changes.\n\nSorry this took so long! The holiday season took its toll, but we also got a bit overzealous with piling feature work on master, and well, we restructured the entire project and re-created its pipeline from scratch, so that didn't help.\n\nOn the plus side, the project restructure is now done, and we'll be implementing a new release process soon that should prevent these kinds of hold-ups from happening again in the future.\n\nSpecial thanks to the many individuals in the community who took part in this release - whether you submitted a PR, helped triage issues, helped people out on the forums or in Discord, or simply cheered us on, every little bit helps keep the project humming along. We deeply appreciate it, and look forward to delivering y'all a better and better CI system - hopefully, more continuously.\n\nWe have done a major internal overhaul of how resource versions are stored. As a result, the version history for each resource across your pipelines will be re-set upon upgrading to v5.0.\n\nThe upgrade does however preserve the state of which versions were disabled, and the data relating versions to builds they were inputs to and outputs of.\n\nIn versions prior to v5.0, resource version history was associated to a pipeline resource by name. This meant that if you changed a resource's configuration or type, those old versions would actually stick around, even though they may technically no longer be appropriate.\n\nWith v5.0, resource versions are now tied directly to an anonymous \"resource config\" - basically the source: and type: for the resource. Pipeline resources instead point to a config, and if their source: or type: changes, they'll point to a new config with its own version history.\n\nThis improves the correctness of the system as a whole, eliminating the need to ever \"purge\" the history of a resource.\n\nIn addition, now that versions are tied directly to their configs, check containers are also shared across teams, reducing the overall container count. As a result however we limited who can fly intercept check containers.\n\nBuilding on this change, we are currently experimenting with improvements that can now be made to reduce the overall checking overhead across a Concourse cluster that has many equivalent resource definitions across pipelines and teams. This is currently off by default while we learn more about the implications - see Global Resources (experimental) for more information.\n\nWe have removed --allow-all-users as almost every use has been a misuse. You must configure users explicitly now instead. This was done for development environments but even those were trivial to switch to a local user whitelist.\n\nIf you were setting this flag before, you probably didn't mean to - setting this with GitHub oAuth configured, for example, would allow literally everyone to be a part of your team and manage your pipelines.\n\nAfter upgrading, any teams that had this configured will preserve the behavior from before - they will continue to allow all users. The next time the teams are configured, however, you will have to specify something else, as the CLI no longer has the flag.\n\nThe concourse binary distribution has been rejiggered. Rather than a self-contained binary, we now ship it as a .tgz containing the binary and its dependencies pre-extracted. The .tgz should be extracted somewhere like /usr/local, resulting in /usr/local/concourse/bin/....\n\nThe main benefit of this is simplification and faster startup. The concourse worker command no longer needs to extract resource types/etc. on start, so this speeds that up quite a bit.\n\nThe concourse binary no longer directly embeds Garden-runC code, and instead ships alongside the gdn binary, copied from their releases. This simplifies the interface for configuring Garden and allows us to leverage their build process rather than risking deviation.\n\nThe \"breaking\" aspect of this is that if you have been passing esoteric flags to Garden you'll have to switch to using a config file via --garden-config instead, or pass them as env vars (e.g. CONCOURSE_GARDEN_FOO_BAR) - flags are no longer supported as those relied on directly embedding their code.\n\nWorkers can now be configured to periodically rebalance so that they don't end up all forwarding through a single Running a web node. This is done by setting the --rebalance-interval flag on concourse worker. The rebalancing makes sure to drain in-flight connections and should not disrupt any in-flight builds.\n\nAlong the way, we removed support for direct worker registration. The --peer-ip flag is no longer available on concourse worker. To transition to 5.0, just remove the flag - the worker will register via forwarding instead.\n\nForwarding is more secure as it doesn't require opening your workers up to inbound traffic. It's easier for us to just focus on one registration method and make sure it works well.\n\nThis also sets us up for enforcing TLS for all traffic to the forwarded workers in the future (concourse #2415).\n\nThe Concourse BOSH release has been redesigned and is now centered around the concourse binary.\n\nBe sure to recreate your workers after or during the deploy, as the location that the worker stores volumes has changed and the old volume directory will not be cleaned up, effectively leaking disk usage.\n\nThe additional_resource_types property can no longer be configured. We plan to add another mechanism for co-located resources in future releases.\n\nThe concourse release no longer needs to be deployed alongside a garden-runc BOSH release, and instead embeds the gdn binary directly.\n\nAlong the way, we have adopted BPM and now use it for deploying the Running a web node. We also enforce a higher nofile limit which should make large-scale deployments more...scaley.\n\nTwo flags have been modified to be more consistent with other flag syntax:\n\n* concourse web --vault-auth-param foo=bar should now be specified as concourse web --vault-auth-param foo:bar (note the :).\n\n* concourse web --tsa-team-authorized-keys team=path/to/key should now be specified as concourse web --tsa-team-authorized-keys team:path/to/key (note the :).\n\nThe Concourse GitHub repository has been completely restructured. This isn't really a feature per se, but it should make contributing a lot easier.\n\nMore on this on our blog post: The Great Process Update of 2018.\n\nA new resource, the registry-image resource, has been added to the core. This resource is intended to replace the docker-image resource image for image pulling and pushing (but not building).\n\nThis resource improves on the docker-image resource in a few ways:\n\n* It doesn't run Docker to fetch the image - it's written in pure Go, using the google/go-containerregistry package. This makes the implementation much less error-prone.\n\n* Because it doesn't run Docker, it doesn't need a privileged container. The fewer privileged containers in your cluster, the better - especially in light of recent CVE fixes.\n\n* By focusing solely on fetching and pushing, the resource is much smaller and simpler. It also has test coverage!\n\n* The output has pretty colors.\n\nThis all results in much faster, more efficient, and resilient image fetching. We recommend everyone to try switching your image_resources and Resource Types over - in most cases this is just a matter of replacing type: docker-image with type: registry-image.\n\nWe intend to deprecate and phase out support for the docker-image resource in favor of the registry-image resource. We can't really do this until there's a solid direction for image building - preferably with a task, not a resource. This is a more natural split, and supports building images without pushing them - a long awaited ask of the docker-image resource.\n\nAn experimental task for this is available at concourse/builder. This is not yet official, but we've using it in our own pipeline and it's been pretty solid. Feel free to give it a try!\n\nThe next step from here is to actually kick off an RFC for reusable tasks - we're still collecting our thoughts for that in (RF)RFC #7. Once this is done we can formalize concourse/builder.\n\nWe have introduced the first phase of role-based access control!\n\nRight now there are only a few statically defined roles. We started off by supporting the common request of having read-only team members ('team viewer'), and adding a slightly less powerful 'team member' role. See User Roles \u0026 Permissions for more information.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of how things have changed:\n\n* Existing team auth config will be transitioned to the Team Owner role - that is, anyone that can authenticate prior to the upgrade will now be authenticated as an owner of their team. This role is the closest equivalent to what they could do before.\n\n* The The main team still has special admin power, with the slight tweak that only users that are an owner of the main team have admin capabilties.\n\n* Before, teams members could rename or destroy their own team. Team owners no longer have this power - only admins can do this.\n\n* The Team Member role is a new role that allows users to have full read and write powers within the team, except for being able to modify the team itself.\n\n* The Team Viewer role is a new role that allows users to browse the team's pipelines, builds, resources, etc. without permitting any sensitive operations (like fly get-pipeline or triggering builds).\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of each role's capabilties, see the Permission Matrix. To learn how to configure these roles after upgrading, see Setting User Roles.\n\nIf you're curious about the design process for this feature, check out RFC #3 (RBAC)!\n\nWe have replaced resource pausing with resource pinning.\n\nResource pausing had the effect of disabling the periodic checking for the paused resource. However we found that in most cases it was being used in combination with disabling versions to effectively pin a resource to the most recent available version.\n\nHowever, with global resource versions, each resource actually points to a shared history, so pausing checking wouldn't be enough - if any other pipelines had the same resource, new versions would still arrive!\n\nSo instead, versions can now be pinned individually via the web UI or via the pipeline config (see version). Pinned resources will also skip periodic checking, but now even if the checking still happens (because some other pipeline had it un-pinned), the resource will stay pinned to the desired version.\n\nA comment can also be left on pinned versions for explaining to your team-mates why you decided to pin the resource.\n\nDuring the 5.0 upgrade, paused resources will be automatically transitioned to their pinned equivalent, by pinning the resource to the most recent available version. A comment will be left on any resources that are migrated so that it's clear to pipeline users.\n\nTask ((vars)) received a bit of an overhaul, thanks to a PR by @ralekseenkov!\n\n* Values for task ((vars)) can now be provided during fly execute!\n\n* In addition, values may be provided to a task step in a pipeline via vars.\n\n* Tasks can now have ((vars)) pretty much anywhere in their config, not just in image_resource.\n\nIn all cases, vars can also be satisifed via a credential manager, the same as before.\n\nAdmittedly, there is now some cause for confusion with params. This may see clarification with reusable tasks. In addition, pipeline ((params)) will now be referred to as pipeline ((vars)) instead, for consistency.\n\nThe Running a web node can now be configured with a The fewest-build-containers strategy, which will place containers on workers that have the fewest build containers.\n\nAny volumes or containers that disappeared from their worker (possibly due to a worker being re-created and then coming back under the same name) will now be automatically reaped from the database. This makes it easier for Concourse to recover from this situation rather than erroring with file not found or unknown handle errors.\n\nLogs emitted by Concourse components will now be...slightly prettier? They're still JSON (sorry), but the timestamps and log levels are at least human-readable.\n\nIf you've got anything parsing your logs, make sure to update it accordingly!\n\nConcourse will now automatically retry fetching credentials when the request to the credential manager fails, thanks to a PR by @ralekseenkov!\n\nBy default Concourse will retry 5 times, waiting 1 second between each attempt. This can be adjusted with the --secret-retry-attempts and --secret-retry-interval flags on concourse web.\n\nTasks are now permitted to have inputs, outputs, and caches with overlapping paths. This was a hold-over from older versions of the container runtime that did not support this.\n\nThis means that for simple tasks that e.g. make a commit a git repo, you no longer need to copy the input to the output. Yay!\n\nThe put step can now be explicitly given a list of inputs to use, rather than using all of them. This can be used to dramatically speed up builds that have a ton of artifacts prior to a put.\n\nThe fly login flow has been reworked a bit to better support logging in to a remote session. There's now a prettier landing page that detects when the token transfer fails by allowing you to copy the token to your clipboard instead.\n\nThe auto-login prompt will also no longer ask for the token, because that disrupts the normal flow of the command. Previously it would ask for a token but then eat half of the keystrokes from then on. Now it just won't ask for a token.\n\nThe concourse binary now has a generate-key subcommand to assist with - you guessed it - key generation. This is more portable to other platforms (I'm looking at you, Windows) and is more likely to generate keys that Concourse can actually accept (I'm looking at you, OpenSSH 7.8).\n\nThe concourse worker command can now be given a --use-houdini flag on Linux to use the \"no-op\" Houdini Garden backend for those odd cases where you don't really want containerization. (Use sparingly.)\n\nThe timestamps shown in the build header will now transition to absolute instead of relative when the build is over 24 hours old. It wasn't very useful to see things like 128d 15h 30m ago when trying to compare old builds. Thanks for the PR, @Twiknight!\n\nYou may have seen a scary error cropping up around your resources now and then. Something like worker_resource_config_check__resource_config_check_sessio_fkey references unreticulated spline.\n\nWe fixed it. That thing doesn't even exist anymore. Don't worry about it.\n\nWith Concourse 4.x configured with an oAuth provider such as GitHub, a user could log in via GitHub even if they weren't technically a member of any team. They couldn't do anything, mind you, but it was confusing that they were allowed to log in in the first place.\n\nThis is no longer permitted.\n\nSimilarly, fly login will also check to make sure you've successfully logged in to the target team and return an error if the team isn't in your token.\n\nThe AWS SSM credential manager and the AWS SecretsManager credential manager previously had a turf war going on over the AWS_REGION environment variable. They both declared it as their own, meaning if you set it they would both try to be configured, which would fail.\n\nThey now have separately namespaced env vars instead.\n\nfly intercept will now give a better error when it fails to execute the command (e.g. because bash isn't installed in the image).\n\nfly execute can now specify input mappings via -m, which is useful when running with --inputs-from-job when the job renames some inputs.\n\nfly execute with --include-ignored will no longer blow up when files are removed locally.\n\nThe error message when a task's file refers to an unknown artifact source (i.e. the foo in foo/ci/task.yml) has been made more descriptive.\n\nThere's a new fly command for landing workers remotely, called... fly land-worker. This will initiate the landing process via the API and will ultimately result in the worker process exiting. (Which may end up being re-started by whatever process monitor you use, but hey, it landed.)\n\nThe web UI now explains why some get steps have a yellow icon, via a handy-dandy tooltip. (Spoiler: it means the job has never run with that version before!)\n\nfly set-pipeline will now notice when the order of Grouping Jobs has changed and show it in the diff.\n\nfly watch can now be called with --timestamps to show per-line timestamps in the build output. Thanks for the PR, @pivotal-kahin-ng!\n\nfly get-pipeline will now throw an error if the specified pipeline does not exist, rather than returning an empty pipeline config.\n\nFixed various subtle UI issues with the dashboard page: concourse #2430, concourse #2434, concourse #2435.\n\nfly login will no longer prompt for your auth method when a username/password are given via flags. It'll deduce that you're trying to do local auth.\n\nTask caches are now supported on Windows!\n\nFixed an internal bug that made UNIQUE constraints for resource_configs ineffective (concourse #2509). This was fairly low-impact, but database integrity matters!\n\nBitBucket auth support has been re-introduced thanks to PRs to Dex and Concourse by @edtan!\n\nThe /api/v1/resources and /api/v1/jobs endpoints will now return [] instead of null when there are no resources or jobs, thanks to a PR by @pivotal-kahin-ng.\n\nThe dashboard page will now indicate whether you are seeing a pipeline because it's exposed by showing an ominous \"eye\" icon.\n\nFixed handling of auth configs set from empty env vars - previously this would result in bogus Dex configuration (e.g. github:, with no org or team) and sometimes cause things to misbehave.\n\nThe legibility and anti-aliasing of text in the web UI has been improved.\n\nCleaned up some dashboard behavior when there are no pipelines:\n\n* you can now see which team you're a member of, rather than one big 'no pipelines set' page\n\n* the bar along the bottom will now show up\n\n* there's a fancy ASCII art UI now\n\n* the search function is no longer shown (since there's nothing to search)\n\n* the HD view has been disabled and just redirects to / instead, since there was nothing for it to show\n\nThe username part of the top bar will no longer detonate when viewed on a tiny mobile browser.\n\nWhen a resource's metadata is suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuper wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide, it will remain cordoned off to the side rather than uncomfortably squishing the resource's get output. Thanks for the fix, @stigtermichiel!\n\nConcourse will now send TCP keepalives for connections to the database. This will allow it to detect when the connection has been interrupted ungracefully. Thanks for the PR, @SimonXming!\n\nThe manifest.json href in the web UI used to be relative to the URL, meaning it was broken on any page except /. This is now fixed.\n\nThe web node used to leak both a connection and a goroutine for each build that completed when configured to drain build logs to syslog. This is now fixed. Sorry about that!\n\nThe resources and resource types returned by fly get-pipeline will now be in a deterministic order, thanks to a PR by @edtan!\n\nfly curl is a new command to assist with (hopefully occasional) manual API requests to Concourse.
