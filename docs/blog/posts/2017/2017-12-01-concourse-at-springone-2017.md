and I will be traveling to San Francisco next week to attend
the [SpringOne Platform 2017](https://springoneplatform.io/) Conference. Not only are there a lot of exciting Spring
talks this year, but there will be a lot of CI/CD talks from some amazing speakers.

Unfortunately none of the Concourse core contribution team will be speaking at SpringOne this year; but that doesn’t
mean there’s a shortage of Concourse-related talks. Here’s a short list of talks from people who will be sharing their
real-world Concourse knowledge and experiences at SpringOne:
