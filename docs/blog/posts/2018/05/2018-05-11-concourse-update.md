Hi folks,

[Joshua Winters](https://medium.com/u/d6d52be6c4b0) has spent a lot of time refactoring Concourse so that it can finally
support Users. We’re finally at a point where we can share some our work with you, so I’d really encourage you to check
out his recent blog post [Oh, Auth](https://medium.com/concourse-ci/oh-auth-f4fe68438171)

<!-- more -->

Outside of that, we’ve got a bunch of vacations going on this week, so it’s been more of the same three tracks of work:

- Users
- Distributed GC on workers
- Spatial Resource flows

See you next week!
