2018 has been an action-packed year for us. We saw a major
release ([Concourse 4.0.0](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v400)) with a lot of new
features: [new auth connectors and users](https://medium.com/concourse-ci/oh-auth-f4fe68438171), [dashboard](https://medium.com/concourse-ci/designing-a-dashboard-for-concourse-fe2e03248751), [distributed GC](https://medium.com/concourse-ci/distributed-garbage-collection-ae3867ab5438)
and other runtime improvements. At the same time our team grew from 3 engineering pairs at the start of 2018 to 8
engineering pairs and an additional PM (👋 [Scott Foerster](https://medium.com/u/86d0fa097bb9)) working on Concourse OSS
and supporting Concourse for PCF.

## By the Numbers

- 13 releases of Concourse
- 1 TLD snafu leading to[our domain change](https://medium.com/concourse-ci/were-switchin-domains-5597dcd0b48b)
- 1 new website design
- 2 new ways to contact us ([Discord](https://discord.gg/MeRxXKW), [Discuss](https://discuss.concourse-ci.org/))
- 1,070 members on Concourse Discord, 45 members in #contributors
- 937 new GitHub issues created in 2018. Given th at only 1,694 issues were opened prior to 2018, I’d say that’s a
  pretty big jump in activity!
- 417 PRs, up by 15% from last year
- 3,300 stars, up by 38% from last year

the health of resources and also took over old resources.

## See you in 2019!

I hope y’all get to enjoy some time off this holiday season. We’ve got a lot of updates planned for 2019, like our new
contributor workflow, Concourse 5.0 and spatial resources! Look forward to an in-depth post
from [Alex Suraci](https://medium.com/u/263a63b2f209) in the next few days.

Thanks again for all the support, and we’ll see you in 2019!
