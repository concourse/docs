Concourse v3.11.0 came out today! Go get
it: [https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v3110](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v3110)

<!-- more -->

On another note: I’ve noticed some interesting articles and guides come out on writing custom resources for Concourse.
There’s one on the Pivotal
blog [https://content.pivotal.io/blog/developing-a-custom-concourse-resource](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/developing-a-custom-concourse-resource)
and another from fellow Medium
writer [Shin Myung Yoon](https://medium.com/u/d58b0a9a1e17) ([https://itnext.io/writing-a-custom-resource-for-concourse-detecting-pull-request-close-merge-events-e40468eb2a81](https://itnext.io/writing-a-custom-resource-for-concourse-detecting-pull-request-close-merge-events-e40468eb2a81))!

[Topher Bullock](https://medium.com/u/58876cdc2180) and I will also be travelling to Boston next week
for [CF Summit 2018](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/event/nasummit2018/). We’ll be around to meet some Pivotal PCF
customers and answer questions about Concourse. Make sure you visit some of the awesome talks on Concourse as well. You
can find some articles about it on the Cloud Foundry blog:

Fun fact: we got some new stickers printed up and we’ll be handing some out at Summit:
