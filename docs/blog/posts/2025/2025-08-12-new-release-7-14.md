[v7.14.0](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v7.14.0) is out
and with it also comes the first ARM build of Concourse! There were a lot of
behind the scenes changes that were required to make this happen, so let's dive
into everything that's in this release.

## 🫆Pipeline Identity Tokens

I figure we'll start with the new features, because that's always fun.
[#9035](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/9035) added a whole new
`var_source` called "Identity Tokens". These are JWT's that Concourse can
generate for you and that you can then use to authenticate to third-party
systems that support "identity federation", such as Vault, AWS, and Azure.

[@dbaumgarten](https://github.com/dbaumgarten) did everything here: wrote the
[RFC](https://github.com/concourse/rfcs/pull/139), made the
[PR](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/9035), AND wrote a
comperhensive set of
[docs](https://concourse-ci.org/idtoken-credential-manager.html) with examples
on how to use it. Huge thank you to him for bringing this feature to the
community. I think a lot of users will find it useful and help them migrate away
from using static credentials.

## 🦾 The Road to ARM

This has been a longgggggg time coming. There was a community fork of Concourse
out there for a while, specifically for building an ARM version of Concourse. I
remember when Ciro, a co-worker from Pivotal, did a [little exploration running
Concourse on his Raspberry
Pi](https://ops.tips/blog/raspberry-pi-concourse-ci-worker/). He showed it was
possible, though the road wasn't completely smooth.

Thankfully, the container ecosystem has continued to develop and mature these last
few years while Concourse was in limbo. More workloads are running on ARM now
and as a result more of our tools and libraries just work when trying to do
cross-compilation or ARM stuff. The big win for us was [Docker making
multi-platform
builds](https://www.docker.com/blog/faster-multi-platform-builds-dockerfile-cross-compilation-guide/)
a thing. This saved us from having to manually build an ARM Concourse worker,
like Ciro did, just so we could build ARM images of Concourse and all the
resource-types that we ship with Concourse.

At this point, all we needed to do was update our pipelines to support building
and releasing ARM versions of _everything!_

The journey went like this:

- Update all 12 base resource-types to use
  [Wolfi](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/) as their base image because the
  previous base image did not have an ARM variant. The `concourse/concourse`
  image also uses Wolfi as its base image now.
- Update the [OCI Build task](https://github.com/concourse/oci-build-task/) and
  [Registry Image
  resource](https://github.com/concourse/registry-image-resource) to better
  support multi-platform images and workflows.
- Update the pipeline used to build, test, and release the resource-types, and
  release ARM versions of all the resource-types.
- Update the main Concourse pipeline and the release pipeline to build and test the ARM variant of Concourse.
- Added a [`/download-fly`](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/9240)
  page to support all variants of `fly`, replacing the three static download
  links previously located in the footer

Each of those steps took many hours to complete. I had to touch every repository
we own and got to do a little clean-up everywhere.

One nice side-effect of moving to Wolfi for the base image is that the size of
all the container images we produce dropped. Some by a lot, some by just a
little. For example, the Git resource went from
[218MB](https://hub.docker.com/layers/concourse/git-resource/1.18/images/sha256-743af77614876650e1842a95b00ba19a90553d97f5d6596fa1b80e3d68f4da44)
to
[37MB](https://hub.docker.com/layers/concourse/git-resource/1.19/images/sha256-b4eb2006bd23ca648e8ca98d42f0281fefb14d0ba392a22288ad7f95e1c73ebb),
a massive drop in size! Some other resources dropped by only a few MB's. The
size drops weren't 100% due to Wolfi. I took some extra time to ensure we were
only adding what was necessary for each resource-type to function.

Collectively, this results in us shipping a much smaller `concourse/concourse`
image. v7.14.0 clocks in at [928MB (x86_64) and 883MB
(ARM)](https://hub.docker.com/layers/concourse/concourse/7.14.0/images/sha256-f68c1c39abbd2b3f8d948b0073f1334292e9eebc92f1ca1c1ab60a54870b989f),
down from [1.41GB
(x86_64)](https://hub.docker.com/layers/concourse/concourse/7.13/images/sha256-cc40ecf37fee9056dad7e0b0751d321e8791449e3fe56603995c2e56a80ad1c1).
That's a 34% drop in size for the x86_64 image and 37% for the ARM image. The
ARM-based images are also always smaller, so you save a bit more disk space if
you go for a fully ARM-based Concourse deployment.

Now there is finally an ARM version of Concourse and fly that folks can run on
their Raspberry Pi's, M-Series macs, and ARM cloud servers. I'm excited to see
what Concourse will end up running on now 🎉

## ☁️ Cloud Foundry Foundation

As a project member of the Cloud Foundry Foundation (CFF), Concourse has had two tasks
assigned to it.

1. Reduce project cost: We've reduced [project costs by
   40%](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/issues/1190#issuecomment-3001014447),
   leaving us in a decent state. There's some smaller things we can tackle, but
   urgency from CFF is gone.
2. Running a [shared Concourse
   cluster](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/1238) for CFF member
   projects. This is related to the CFF's wider goal of reducing costs across
   all projects. This is something myself and Derek plan to work on over the
   next few months.

## 🧭 What's Next

My goal with Concourse right now is to continue to refine and improve what we
currently have. There are plenty of little bugs littered throughout the code
base that I want to resolve to help make Concourse feel even more stable and
reliable than it currently is.

I try to keep this [GitHub project
board](https://github.com/orgs/concourse/projects/53) up to date with what I
plan to work on. Folks are free to look at the board, and if it isn't in the "In
Progress" column, feel free to pick up the issue and work on it.

I'll be putting a lot of my attention to the breaking changes planned for v8.
See [this discussion post](https://github.com/orgs/concourse/discussions/9184)
for details and leave any thoughts or comments there.

That's all I have for everyone now. See everyone over on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/MeRxXKW) or [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/concourse/discussions). Enjoy the new
release!
