It's the May 2025 project update! I'm going to try and do this at a somewhat regular cadence. Once a month seems like a
good idea, though I may skip a month here and there if there's nothing interesting to write about.

## Administrative

I've opened up a [discussion thread](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/discussions/9184) about the breaking changes
currently planned to go into v8 of Concourse. Nothing is set in stone, all feedback is welcome! Likely the most
disruptive one so far is to finally enforce
the [valid identifiers](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/discussions/9184#discussioncomment-13077550) instead of
warning when they're detected. See the link for full details and reasoning.

The [Concourse Working Group](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/working-groups/concourse.md) has
been meeting once per month. You can view past meetings
on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_XoNsUtX-Y&list=PLhuMOCWn4P9ji8ZCY2a-FvMeT7S74-Hhm) and
view [meeting notes here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KSp7npDEARGbsp5SmB2DHp4VJCEJ0GAqYwv9ixHH2DI/).

The last thing I want to mention is that I decided to step away from [CentralCI](https://centralci.com/). They are still
operating and working at making a fantastic managed Concourse that you can go and buy right now!!! If you want Concourse
but don't want the overhead of running it, I highly recommend reaching out to them. I will be focusing my time on the
community and those currently running Concourse on-premise.

If you want to support my work stewarding Concourse you
can [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/taylorsilva). Thank you to those who already found the page and
are sponsoring me 💙

## Roadmap

I have two project boards that I'm using to track work right now.

- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/concourse/projects/53)
- [Pull Requests](https://github.com/orgs/concourse/projects/54)

The Roadmap board is tracking work that I am actively working on and planning to work on next. Right now the ARM build
stuff is taking up most of my time. I have to update some of the tooling we use to build images (the registry-image
resource and oci-build task) to make it easier to build and push multi-arch images. I'm also taking the time to clean up
a bunch of stuff in the [concourse/ci](https://github.com/concourse/ci) repo. It's a lot of work but it's slowly
happening. I see no major roadblocks with this work right now.

The Pull Requests board is a place for me to see all open pull requests across all repositories. I've added most open
PR's to this board. If you see your PR on this board, that means I'm aware of it and I'll get to it eventually.

## S3 Resource Type

I made a few breaking changes with the [S3 resource type](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource) that came out with
7.13. The [v2.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource/releases/tag/v2.0.0) go over those. I did not
hit the mark with these changes sadly. Users found that they couldn't pull down items from public S3 buckets. Resources
pulling from public buckets were using no credentials previously, but with v2 they now tried to use any credentials the
default SDK authentication chain could find, which usually ended up being an EC2 instance profile. I then made
a [PR](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource/pull/187) to fix this, but then that made it, again, impossible for
users to use the EC2 instance profile. Fritz then made a [PR](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource/pull/189) that
adds a new flag to the S3 resource, `enable_aws_creds_provider`, which allows the behaviour introduced in v2 to happen
if you want it to.

I published a new version of the resource type with this
PR, [v2.2.0](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource/releases/tag/v2.2.0). If you want to use that in your pipelines
you can do so with this snippet:

```yaml
resource_types:
  - name: s3
    type: registry-image
    source:
      repository: docker.io/concourse/s3-resource
      tag: 2.2.0
```

That will override the S3 resource type found on the worker for pipelines that you add this to. Apologies again for the
blunder and thank you to those who helped get the resource back in a state that works for everyone.

## VS Code Extension

Shouting this out as it looks handy. A user made a VS code extension for previewing Concourse pipelines. You can see
their post where that shared that here: https://github.com/concourse/concourse/discussions/9193

## Cloud Foundry Day North America

[Cloud Foundry Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cloud-foundry-day-north-america/) is happening next week on May
14th. Derek (my co-lead of the Concourse working group) [has a talk](https://sched.co/1xAEo) about Concourse's journey
into the Cloud Foundry foundation. Make sure you check it out and say hi to Derek if you'll be there.

## That's All Folks!

And that's the update! If anyone wants to chat I'm always hanging around on [discord](https://discord.gg/MeRxXKW). You
can also reach me at `dev` at `taydev.net`.
