The following sections describes operator-focused features and tools that Concourse provides, such as monitoring and
credential management.

These concepts are not required to operate Concourse, but are for users that are looking to extend the capabilities of
managing a Concourse deployment. For users that are new to these concepts, we do recommend learning how to set
up [Credential Management](creds/index.md) and [Encryption](encryption.md).
