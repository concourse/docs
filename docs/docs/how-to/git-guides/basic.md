All of these examples use the [concourse/git-resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) image. That image is
probably the most popular git resource for Concourse since it is shipped in
the [concourse/concourse](https://hub.docker.com/r/concourse/concourse) image and in the tarball on
the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases). It is not the only resource available for
working with git-related resources. If you don't see your use-case on this page then there is probably another resource
that you can use. For example, Pull Request workflows can be accomplished with
the [teliaoss/github-pr-resource](https://github.com/telia-oss/github-pr-resource).

Check out the [docs](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) for the git resource for all configuration options.
