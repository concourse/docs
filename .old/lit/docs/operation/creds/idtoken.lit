\title{\aux{The }IDToken credential manager}{idtoken-credential-manager}

\use-plugin{concourse-docs}
\omit-children-from-table-of-contents

This idtoken credential manager is a bit special. It doesn't load any
credentials from an external source but instead generates
\link{JWTs}{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519} which are signed by
concourse and contain information about the pipeline/job that is currently
running. It can NOT be used as a cluster-wide credential manager, but must
instead be used as a \reference{var-sources}{var source}.

These JWTs can be used to authenticate with external services via "identity
federation" with the identity of the pipeline.

Examples for services that support authentication via JWTs are:

\list{
  \link{Vault}{https://vaultproject.io}
}{
  \link{AWS}{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html}
}{
  \link{Azure}{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/federatedidentitycredentials-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0}
}


External services can verify if JWTs are actually issued by your Concourse, by
checking the signatures on the JWTs against the public keys published by your
Concourse.

The public keys for verification are published as \link{JWKS}{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517} at:
\codeblock{bash}{{{
https://your-concourse-server.com/.well-known/jwks.json
}}}

Concourse also offers a \link{OIDC Discovery
Endpoint}{https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html}, which
allows external services to auto-discover the JWKS-URL.

\section{
  \title{Usage}

  You create a \reference{var-sources}{var source} of type \code{idtoken} with
  the configuration you want (see
  \reference{idtoken-credential-manager-config}{Configuration}) in your
  pipeline. That var source then exposes a single variable with a single field,
  \code{token}, which contains the JWT and can be used in any step of your
  pipeline.

  You can also have multiple \code{idtoken} var sources in the same pipeline,
  each with different audiences, lifetimes etc.

  \codeblock{bash}{{{
  var_sources:
  - name: myidtoken
    type: idtoken
    config:
      audience: ["sts.amazonaws.com"]

  jobs:
  - name: print-creds
    plan:
    - task: print
      config:
        platform: linux
        image_resource:
          type: mock
          source: {mirror_self: true}
        run:
          path: bash
          args:
          - -c
          - |
            echo myidtoken: ((myidtoken:token))
  }}}
}

\section{
  \title{Configuration}{idtoken-credential-manager-config}

  You can pass several config options to the \code{idtoken} var source to
  customize the generated JWTs. For example, you can configure the \code{aud}
  claim, token expiration, or granularity of the \code{sub} claim. See
  \reference{idtoken-var-source} for all config options.

  \section{
    \title{Subject Scope}{idtoken-subject-scope}

    Some external services (like AWS) only perform exact-matches on a token's
    sub-claim and ignore most other claims. To enable use-cases like \italic{"all
    pipelines of a team should be able to assume an AWS-Role"}, Concourse offers
    the option to configure how granular the \code{sub} claim's value should be.

    This is configured via the \code{subject_scope} setting of the \reference{idtoken-var-source}.

    Depending on the value of \code{subject_scope}, the content of the JWT's
    \code{sub} claim will differ:

      \table{
        \table-row{\code{subject_scope}}{\code{sub} Value in JWT}
       }{
        \table-row{
          \code{team}
        }{
          \code{<team_name>}
        }
      }{
        \table-row{
          \code{pipeline}
        }{
          \code{<team_name>/<pipeline_name>}
        }
      }{
        \table-row{
          \code{instance}
        }{
          \code{<team_name>/<pipeline_name>/<instance_vars>} \superscript{1}
        }
      }{
        \table-row{
          \code{job}
        }{
          \code{<team_name>/<pipeline_name>/<instance_vars>/<job_name>} \superscript{2}
        }
      }

      \list{
        \smaller{[1]: Instance vars are rendered as comma-separated key-value pairs.
          E.g. \code{my-var:my-value,hello:world}
        }
      }{
        \smaller{[2]: If a path element is empty (for example because you chose
          \code{job} on a pipeline with no instance-vars), the empty element is
          still added. E.g. \code{my-team/my-pipeline//my-job}. Note the double
          forward-slashes between the pipeline and job name, where instance vars
          would go.
        }
      }


    This way all your pipelines can simply get a token with
    \code{subject_scope: team} and use this token to assume an AWS-Role that
    matches on \code{sub: "your_team_name"}.

  }

}

\section{
  \title{Example JWT}

  The generated tokens usually look something like this:
  \code{
    eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL3lvdXItY29uY291cnNlLmV4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxMDE1NzM0LCJhdWQiOlsiYXBpOi8vQXp1cmVBRFRva2VuRXhjaGFuZ2UiXSwic3ViIjoibWFpbi9leGFtcGxlLXBpcGVsaW5lIiwidGVhbSI6Im1haW4iLCJwaXBlbGluZSI6ImV4YW1wbGUtcGlwZWxpbmUiLCJqb2IiOiJleGFtcGxlLWpvYiJ9.my7l44tH0wfz8vc6z3fMmzTMxZ8_orhjcsOti3BKSNo
  }

  And after decoding, looks like this:
  \codeblock{bash}{{{
    {
      "aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
      "exp": 1751282764,
      "iat": 1751279164,
      "iss": "https://your-concourse-server.com",
      "job": "print-creds",
      "pipeline": "mypipeline",
      "sub": "main/mypipeline",
      "team": "main"
    }
  }}}

  Here is a short explanation of the different claims:

  \list{
    \code{iss}: Who issued the token. Contains the OIDC issuer URL if \code{--oidc-issuer-url} is configured, otherwise the external URL of your Concourse.
  }{
    \code{exp}: When the token will expire
  }{
    \code{aud}: Who the token is intended for. (In the above example it's for Azure's Identity Federation API)
  }{
    \code{team}: The team of the pipeline this token was generated for
  }{
    \code{pipeline}: The pipeline this token was generated for
  }{
    \code{job}: The name of the job (inside the pipeline) this token was generated for
  }{
    \code{instance_vars}: Any instance vars for the pipeline (if it is an
    instanced pipeline). Will be a comma-separated list of key-value pairs.
    E.g. \code{hello:world,my-var:my-value}
  }{
    \code{sub}: A combination of team + pipeline + instance_vars + job. Which
    parts are used here is configurable, see
    \reference{idtoken-subject-scope}.
  }
}

\section{
  \title{Automatic Key Rotation}{idtoken-key-rotation}

  Concourse will automatically rotate the signing keys used for creating the JWTs. The default rotation period is \code{7 days}. The previously used keys are being kept around for a while (by default \code{24h})
  so that verification of currently existing JWTs doesn't fail during key rotation.

  This behavior can be configured via the following ATC flags:

  \list{
    \code{CONCOURSE_SIGNING_KEY_ROTATION_PERIOD}: How often to rotate the signing keys. Default: \code{7d}. A value of \code{0} means don't rotate at all.
  }{
    \code{CONCOURSE_SIGNING_KEY_GRACE_PERIOD}: How long to keep previously used signing keys published in the JWKs after they have been rotated. Default: \code{24h}.
  }{
    \code{CONCOURSE_SIGNING_KEY_CHECK_INTERVAL}: How often to check if new keys are needed or if old ones should be removed. Default: \code{10m}
  }

}

\section{
  \title{Configuring a Separate OIDC Issuer}{idtoken-oidc-issuer}

  By default, Concourse uses the \code{--external-url} as the OIDC issuer in generated tokens. You can configure a separate OIDC issuer URL using the \code{--oidc-issuer-url} flag:

  \codeblock{bash}{{{
  concourse web \
    --external-url https://concourse.internal.example.com \
    --oidc-issuer-url https://oidc.example.com
  }}}

  When \code{--oidc-issuer-url} is configured:
  \list{
    The \code{iss} claim in generated JWT tokens will contain the OIDC issuer URL instead of the external URL
  }{
    The OIDC discovery endpoints (\code{/.well-known/openid-configuration} and \code{/.well-known/jwks.json}) will return the OIDC issuer URL
  }{
    Your Concourse web UI and API continue to use the external URL
  }

  This is useful for private network deployments where you want to serve OIDC discovery from a separate public endpoint while keeping your Concourse instance private.

  \warn{When the signing keys rotate, Concourse immediately uses the new key for signing tokens. If your OIDC issuer URL is out of sync with Concourse's JWKS, token verification will fail. The recommended approach is to use a reverse proxy that forwards requests to your private Concourse in real-time, eliminating sync delays during key rotation.}

}

\right-side{Examples}{
  \example{Vault}{
    You can use JWTs to authenticate with \link{HashiCorp
    Vault}{https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/jwt#jwt-authentication}.
    This way your pipelines can directly communicate with Vault and use all of
    it's features, beyond what Concourse's native Vault-integration offers.

    First enable the JWT auth method in your Vault Server:
    \codeblock{bash}{{{
      vault auth enable jwt
    }}}

    Now configure the JWT auth method to accept JWTs issued by your Concourse (use your \code{--oidc-issuer-url} if configured, otherwise your external URL - see \reference{idtoken-oidc-issuer}):
    \codeblock{bash}{{{
    vault write auth/jwt/config \
      oidc_discovery_url="https://<external_url_or_oidc_issuer_url>" \
      default_role="demo"
    }}}

    Lastly, configure a role for JWT auth. Make sure to use the same value in
    your pipeline that you used for \italic{bound_audiences} (the best would be
    the URL of your Vault). \italic{bound_subject} must be the sub-claim value
    of your JWT, if you use the \italic{subject_scope} setting to change the
    contents of your sub-claim, adapt this accordingly!
    \codeblock{bash}{{{
      vault write auth/jwt/role/demo \
      role_type="jwt"\
      user_claim="sub" \
      bound_subject="main/your-pipeline" \
      bound_audiences="my-vault-server.com" \
      policies=webapps \
      ttl=1h
    }}}

    This role will allow the holder of a JWT with
    \code{aud: "my-vault-server.com"} and \code{sub: "main/your-pipeline"} to get
    a Vault token with the Vault-policy \code{webapps}. If the policy you want to
    assign has a different name, simply change it in the above example. Make
    sure to adapt the value for \code{bound_subject} according to your team
    and pipeline name.

    Pipelines can now do the following:
    \codeblock{yaml}{{{
      var_sources:
      - name: vaulttoken
        type: idtoken
        config:
          audience: ["my-vault-server.com"]

      jobs:
      - name: vault-login
        plan:
        - task: login
          config:
            platform: linux
            image_resource:
              type: registry-image
              source: { repository: hashicorp/vault }
            run:
              path: sh
              args:
              - -e
              - -c
              - |
                export VAULT_ADDR=https://my-vault-server.com
                vault write auth/jwt/login \
                  role=demo \
                  jwt=((vaulttoken:token)) \
                  --format=json > vault-response.json
                echo "Now do something with the token in vault-response.json"
    }}}

    You don't have to create a role and a policy for every single of your
    pipelines! You can use claims from the JWT with Vault's \link{policy
    templating}{https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/policies/policy-templating}
    feature. This way you can define a policy that allows a pipeline read to
    all the secrets it would usually have access to using Concourse's native
    Vault-integration:

    \codeblock{bash}{{{
      path "concourse/metadata/{{ identity.entity.aliases.<JWT_ACCESSOR>.metadata.team }}" {
        capabilities = ["list"]
      }

      path "concourse/data/{{ identity.entity.aliases.<JWT_ACCESSOR>.metadata.team }}/+" {
        capabilities = ["read"]
      }

      path "concourse/metadata/{{ identity.entity.aliases.<JWT_ACCESSOR>.metadata.team }}/{{ identity.entity.aliases.<JWT_ACCESSOR>.metadata.pipeline }}" {
        capabilities = ["list"]
      }

      path "concourse/metadata/{{ identity.entity.aliases.<JWT_ACCESSOR>.metadata.team }}/{{ identity.entity.aliases.<JWT_ACCESSOR>.metadata.pipeline }}/*" {
        capabilities = ["read", "list"]
      }

      path "concourse/data/{{ identity.entity.aliases.<JWT_ACCESSOR>.metadata.team }}/{{ identity.entity.aliases.<JWT_ACCESSOR>.metadata.pipeline }}/*" {
        capabilities = ["read", "list"]
      }
    }}}
    \smaller{Make sure to set \code{<JWT_ACCESSOR>} to the actual
      mount-accessor value of your JWT Auth method! You can use \code{vault auth
      list --format=json | jq -r '."jwt/".accessor'} to get the accessor for your
      jwt auth method.
    }

    With a policy like this you don't need to configure \code{bound_subject}
    in your JWT auth role. Every single pipeline can simply use the same role
    and the policy will take care that they can only access secrets meant for
    them. However you need to explicitly configure claim to metadata mapping:

    \codeblock{bash}{{{
      vault write auth/jwt/role/demo \
        role_type="jwt"\
        user_claim="sub" \
        bound_subject= \
        bound_audiences="my-vault-server.com" \
        policies=pipeline-new \
        claim_mappings='team=team' \
        claim_mappings='pipeline=pipeline' \
        ttl=1h
    }}}

  }

  \example{AWS}{
    AWS supports \link{federation with external identity
    providers}{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html}.
    Using this, you can allow identities managed by an external identity
    provider to perform actions in your AWS account.

    In this scenario the external identity provider is Concourse and the
    identities are teams/pipelines/jobs. This means you are able to grant a
    specific pipeline or job permission to perform actions in AWS (like
    deploying something), all without managing IAM users or dealing with
    long-lived credentials.

    First you need to \link{create an OpenID Connect identity
    provider}{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html}
    in your AWS Account.
    Set \italic{Provider URL} to the external URL of your Concourse server (or the \code{--oidc-issuer-url} if you're using a separate OIDC issuer - see \reference{idtoken-oidc-issuer}).
    For \italic{Audience}, you can choose any string you like, but using
    a value like \code{sts.amazonaws.com} is recommended. You have to use the
    same string later in the configuration of your \reference{idtoken-var-source}.

    Next you will need to \link{create an IAM-Role that can be assumed using
    your
    JWT}{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html#idp_oidc_Create}.
    Set \italic{Identity Provider} to the value you previously set \italic{Audience} to.
    Add a condition on the sub-claim with type \code{StringEquals} and value
    \code{yourteam/yourpipeline}. This will allow ONLY that specific pipeline
    (and any instanced versions of it) to assume that IAM Role using a JWT. If
    you use the \code{subject_scope} setting to change the contents of your
    sub-claim, adapt this condition accordingly!
    In the next step you will be able to choose which AWS permissions your role will get.

    Now you can use the AWS \link{AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API
    operation}{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html}
    to assume your role via a JWT issued by Concourse. The easiest way is to do
    this is via the \link{assume-role-with-web-identity AWS CLI
    command}{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/assume-role-with-web-identity.html}:

    \codeblock{yaml}{{{
      var_sources:
      - name: awstoken
        type: idtoken
        config:
          audience: ["sts.amazonaws.com"]

      jobs:
      - name: aws-login
        plan:
        - task: print
          config:
            platform: linux
            image_resource:
              type: registry-image
              source: { repository: amazon/aws-cli }
            run:
              path: bash
              args:
              - -e
              - -c
              - |
                aws sts assume-role-with-web-identity \
                  --role-session-name Concourse \
                  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<your_account>:role/<your_role> \
                  --web-identity-token ((awstoken:token)) > creds.json
                echo "Now do something with the temporary credentials in creds.json"
    }}}
  }

  \example{Azure}{
    Azure also supports a way to grant the holder of a JWT permissions in the
    Cloud. This is done via a feature called \link{Federated
    Credentials}{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/federatedidentitycredentials-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0}.

    First, \link{create an EntraID App
    Registration}{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app}.
    This app registration will be the service principal used by your pipeline.

    Now \link{create a federated
    credential}{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#other-identity-providers}
    for the app registration you just created.

    For \italic{Scenario} select "Other". For \italic{Issuer} set it to the
    external URL of your Concourse server (or the \code{--oidc-issuer-url} if you're using a separate OIDC issuer - see \reference{idtoken-oidc-issuer}). For \italic{Type} select "Explicit
    subject identifier" and set \italic{Value} to
    \code{<teamname>/<pipelinename>} of the pipeline that should be able to use
    the identity. If you use the \code{subject_scope} setting to change the
    contents of your sub-claim, change this setting here accordingly.

    You can now assign IAM permissions to the identity of the app registration,
    which define what the identity is allowed to do in your Azure subscription.

    Your pipeline can now use the \code{az} cli to login to Azure using a JWT generated by Concourse:
    \codeblock{yaml}{{{
      var_sources:
      - name: azuretoken
        type: idtoken
        config:
          audience: ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]

      jobs:
      - name: azure-deploy
        plan:
        - task: login
          config:
            platform: linux
            image_resource:
              type: registry-image
              source: { repository: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli }
            run:
              path: bash
              args:
              - -e
              - -c
              - |
                echo ((azuretoken:token))
                az login --service-principal \
                  -u <client_id of your app registration> \
                  --tenant <tenant_id of your app registration> \
                  --federated-token ((azuretoken:token))
                echo "You are now authenticated with Azure. Do something with it!"
    }}}

  }
}
